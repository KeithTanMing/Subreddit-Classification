Trucker helped with flat tire,3rd_Coast,"I got a flat tire on a highway in Arizona, right before a bridge over a river. I lost tire pressure very quickly and had to pull over in a fairly unsafe spot. I tried changing it myself but put the jack in the wrong position because it was dark and I was freaked out. A trucker on his way to Calexico pulled over and put out high vis signs and helped me get my spare on correctly with his jack. 
He took the time and put his safety on the line to help me, and I’m so grateful. He chatted with me to calm me down too, and he has a dog that he saved from being run over that he travels with! Humans are awesome sometimes.",0
Guy caught me before nearly cracking head open,dqkaoaa,"TD: LR Cut myself and passed about, Guy caught me before I landed on a Sink and cracked my head

&#x200B;

This was about two months ago, I was in a wood workshop and I was chiselling a wood project when it slipped and sliced a bit of my finger, I immediately ran over and put it underwater (I don't pass out usually until cuts are underwater) 

This was when a guy came over to help with some medical supplies, as he was getting them out I started to feel like passing out and I fell, banged my head on a Band Saw machine, and fell. He caught me inches before I would have cracked my head open on a sink.

Now we regularly joke about it all.",0
"Someone bought me lunch in my college, what’s the best way I can pay them back?",SolarNovaPhoenix,"So because I’m cheap instead of going to the cafeteria, I go to the on campus bookstore which sells snacks and food pretty cheap but more pricy than they’d be at the local supermarket. So I was gonna by my noodles and soda for around $2.75 and I only have my debit card which I know has at least $10 so it was a malfunction on the machine’s side, so I put the food away and was about to walk out when a staff member puts it on his own tab and tells me to go ahead and get it. Now I feel the overwhelming urge to do something to either pay him back or pay the kindness forward. What should I do?",0
Bought Vereran Lunch,halliwell03,"I get carryout about twice a week at the same spot. Everytime I enter the restaurant I see a man sitting by himself with a WW2 hat on stating he was in the war. Today I got the urge and I paid for his burger,fries,and coffee.",0
Shovelled a few driveways for elderly neighbors without being asked.,snowblind2112,"So it's Thanksgiving weekend up here in Canada, which also happened to coincide with a CRAZY early winter storm. Lots of thick & heavy snow, widespread power outages and trees down EVERYWHERE. My wife and I dug ourselves out, and made our way to my mom's place for a nice dinner. 

While there, I saw her elderly (70+) neighbor doing her best to clear her driveway, but she was clearly struggling. I told two of my nephews to get their jackets and shoes on, we're going to help (they agreed without a word of protest, I was supremely impressed).

So we bounce across the street, shovels in hand and ask her if she would like any help with clearing her driveway. She asks what we're charging and with a big grin I tell her that we're not there for money, just to help out someone on thanksgiving. She accepts our help, and we begin to make short work of clearing all the snow off her driveway.

While we were working, another elderly lady from across the street comes out and says ""I don't know what she's paying you but I'll match it if you want to come help me!"" I walked over and talked with her, and we agreed to go dig her out after dinner.

 Lady 1 asks again if we want compensation as we finish, and when we decline she insists on making a donation to the charity of our choice (the local Humane Society).

Dinner was DELICIOUS, a thanksgiving feast I felt we had surely earned at that point. After eating and a bit of time to digest, I rally the troops and off we went to rescue Lady 2. I knocked on the door just to be sure we were at the right house (two driveways side-by-side). She answered with cash in hand, and while I tried to politely decline, she insisted that she pay us for helping. I agreed, letting my nephews split the bit of money she gave us.

We spent another 20-25 minutes clearing her driveway, then went back to the house for coffee and dessert, made that much sweeter by the sincere appreciation offered by both women we helped that night.

"“Wait, here you go!” after I opened the door for him",Silent_Lettuce,"I was exiting a campus building with my lunch in hand, when I heard the rattling of someone pushing a cart. He was a bit farther behind in the hallway (I came from the stairs) and I was already through the first set of doors to exit. Still, I know it’s a pain to open those doors if you’re pushing something large and heavy, so I did what I thought anyone else would do; I went to the side and pushed the handicap button so that the double doors would open automatically. Then I looked for the button for the outer set of doors and did the same. 

It really just felt like a normal thing to do. I hold doors open for people all the time, because its a small gesture that can go a long way, and chivalry be damned, girls can open doors for others too. So I just kept walking, but then the guy called after me. He was going to load the stuff in the cart to a truck that was parked outside the building, and he held a water bottle out to me and told me to take it as a thank you. I accepted but was very caught off-guard. I’ve never really expected anything in return, and also don’t think he realized how much that water bottle meant to me.

We ran out of water bottles in my apartment, and I lost my reusable water bottle, so his token of appreciation meant I wasn’t going to go thirsty during fencing practice later that day. Even the smallest gestures can mean a lot.",0
This was when I was young but I still feel it fits here.,ioutclassandoutsuck," Before they started rigging them I was a prodigy at claw games (I got 4 with one claw at some point.) So I would win about 30 plushies and stuffed animals a week from various gas stations  with money I earned helping around the neighborhood , and every week I'd gather up 99% of them (I was 10 after all I did want one or two) and we went to a few day cares and pre k places and donate them. I had known what it was like to not have anything  ... so I didn't want others to feel like that. I gave so many that many kids got to pick one and take them home according to the people I would donate to.""if you can help, help""/""if helping doesnt hurt you then theres no harm in it""-my mom haha.",0
One day on Pokémon go...,TerminalVR,"Not entirely sure if this belongs in this subreddit, but it seems like the right place for this little story.  

So I just went out to play Pokémon go, and shortly after setting out, I came across a flip phone on the ground.  It looked like it would start raining, so I picked it up and checked to see if it was functional, which it was.  After initially failing to determine who it belonged to I headed towards a nearby police station. On the way, it rang and the one calling was the owner.  He requested I take it to a location that is somewhat difficult to get to on foot due to the maze of streets and intense hills (as I was walking at the time) so I complied.  

Upon getting there, there was a brief exchange of words as I handed it to the one waiting for it, and I’m happy to say the phone and any valuable data inside is now on its way to the rightful owner.",0
Random Act on the Road,Kaelotheros,"Not 100% sure if fits in but ya never know. 

Also apologies, using mobile so if it all comes out funky blame samsung. 

Driving down a busy road minding my own business, listening to some cage the elephant, when i notice this guy in front of me light up a ciggarette in his car. 

I smoke too so could care less. 

As we chug along the hellscape that is the 3PM traffic rush in my town, a lady with a lil baby in the backseat with all windows down pulls up next to the guy smoking. 

He immediately notices the kid and proceeds to roll his windows up while his cigg is still lit. 

The green light hits and they both go they're own ways. But its the small things like such that still makes me think theres those out there that are truly aware of others.",0

Golf club worker,superdr1ve,"There a golf course really near to where i live and I often go to the club for fries and soda, and there's one guy who always is their, working ad a cashier/server I guess, and I will refer to him as micah, not his real name but fits him I guess. One day i was waiting for my fries, and he comes up to me and just asks how everything is going, I say its fine and he asks what I've been up to lately, I tell him I'm quite by with school, motocross, and my job. Micah asks me what I plan to do after school, and this part really made my day, I told him I really wasnt sure, and that I'd probably end up working more and maybe go to college for a few years. He then gives me advise on savings, and college, and I'm just here to say thank you to him, as his advice has stuck with me since then and I will most likely follow it. Thank you for reading.",0

Happened to Run Out of Gas At the Right Place and Time.,halfarmor,"I ran out of gas this morning on my way to work. My motorcycle does not have a gas gage, but it does have a reserve tank, so not a big deal. It takes a few minutes for the reserve tank to trickle in. I had pulled over to sit and wait for that to happen after my tank went out.

 In the same place that I pulled in was a white SUV. After I arrived the woman in the SUV explained she was lost, her phone was dead, and she was on her way to teach students at her new job. This was not a popular place to pull over, it was on a back road pulled into the parking lot of some empty building. I simply showed her in the direction to go on my phone, and she thanked me and went on her way. Once I did this, my motorcycle was ready and I was on my way. 

Lady, wherever you are, the universe has plans for you. Something pulled me into THAT parking lot for 3 minutes, and I think it was for you. Hope you teach the future leaders of our nation.",0
Old man insists child is seen by doctors first,TrencherB,"  

So, I do not know if this is the correct channel or not, but I thought I would share this story.

I had knee surgery yesterday and went back in to urgent care because of significant bleeding (torn stitch). The waiting area was mostly empty, just a few other people. While I was waiting a couple came in with a baby. They seemed a little bit frantic and the infant was making an unhappy mix of crying and dry coughing. They were directed to wait

A short bit later an elderly guy comes in and states he is having some issue with his hip. From the significant limp and sour look on his face it must have been bothering him a good bit. I am not sure how old he is, but based on the faded Korean War Air Force cap, he had to be up there.

As wait and time continues to tick buy, the baby continues to make the rasping cry/cough and I notice the old guy starting to get agitated. Looking over at them, looking at the clock, etc. Finally, his name is called and he manages to get up with his face scrunched in annoyance.

When he gets up to the nurse waiting for him, he points back towards where the couple is sitting trying to comfort their child and says that they need to be seen first. When the nurse says that they see people based on need and priority, he interrupts her and states that he “is half dead, so you are going to see to that child. And I am going to wait.” 

That is then what happened. I know that the hospital staff have their own issues and having someone be disruptive like that does not make their jobs any easier. It was just really nice to see someone insist that their pain was not as important as the health of a child.",0

You never know what someone is going through,meggie_doodles,"Today I met a man, let's call him Lloyd, on the bus heading home from work. He's an African American man in his mid fifties, carrying two large trash bags. One was full of clothes, the other was heavier and had some stereo equipment. The one with stereo equipment had a huge rip at the bottom and was close to falling apart. A ton of people pointed this out to him, but he shrugged and said ""Nothing I can do about that now.""

Now, my bus stop is incredibly close to my house and my car. He was still there when my stop was next, so I offered to give him a ride home so his bag wouldn't rip. He happily agreed and I helped him carry his things off the bus and we loaded everything into my car.

Then Lloyd says to me, ""You wouldn't believe the day I just had."" Turns out, he went around town trying to sell his most expensive things (church clothes, stereo, DVD player) because he didn't have enough money to buy his kids groceries.

Everywhere he went turned him away thinking they were stolen goods. One woman LITERALLY said ""We don't want your kind here"". Now, I obviously don't know these people he interacted with, but Lloyd is a very mild-mannered guy. On the bus he was timid and tried to turn down the man who gave his seat up for him. In talking with him, I can genuinely say that Lloyd is a sweetheart. Again, I don't know the people who he interacted with, but I think it's safe to say we all know why he was turned away.

On top of all that bullshit, the reason Lloyd doesn't have enough money to afford groceries is because he was in a hit-and-run 10 months ago. He was crossing the street in the middle of the day and some fucker who wasn't paying attention smashed into him and drove off. Lloyd's family is already below the poverty line and now he hasn't been able to work due to complications from BEING RUN OVER.

You know, I'm actually doing pretty well right now. My work is great and satisfying, I have wonderful friends and a fabulous support network, and I'm getting my yearly raise at the end of this month. I offered to take him to Aldi and buy his family groceries for the next week.

So we went to Aldi and stocked up. He was so sweet and kept comparing prices and trying to find the cheapest things and I kept telling him it was no big deal, just get whatever his kids would like. He told me he had been rationing ramen packets between him and his kids for the last week. His kids have an overdue balance on their school lunches and have been denied food for a few weeks. We got stuff for sandwiches and snacks and dinner and all that jazz.

You know what all this cost me? About $100 and an hour of my day. Nobody should have to go hungry, try to sell their most valuable things and get fucking shit on about it.

There is so much ugliness in this world right now, so much hate and neglect and it fucking kills me. The only way I can think of to make it better is to just do something, even if it's small. My point in telling you all this is if you see someone struggling, offer to lend a hand. Put some good back into the world. It's the only way to fight back.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger! I spoke with the local representative in his area today and got a whole bunch of resources that could help him out, so I'll be stopping by his place tonight. I'll keep you all posted!",0

I spent my Monday evening at the local police department helping to reunite a family,axyaliendragon,"It was my last day at work as the season is over (I work a seasonal job). My boss let me go home an hour early as a thank you for all my hard work this summer. I stop at a gas station on the way back since it'll be my last opportunity to get cheap gas. 

While at the station I notice a tall, elderly gentleman walking around asking for directions from several people. He looked well-dressed and had well-kept hair, so didn't seem to be homeless. He talks to the attendant who's filling my tank before walking down the road a ways to try and get a ride from someone else leaving the station. The attendant tells me the dude is really confused and doesn't seem to know where he is. I tell the attendant we should maybe call the police for a welfare check, but the attendant seems hesitant. 

During this time there's an absolutely massive thunderstorm rolling in which I drove through on my way back from work. Hail, pouring rain, lightning, you name it. It was so bad I passed at least a half dozen vehicles pulled over on the side of the road because they simply couldn't see the road in those conditions. I absolutely did not want to leave this confused man out in that weather.

As I'm getting my tank filled the man walks off down the highway and out of sight. I tell myself I'll drive down the highway and if I spot him I'll check on him and see if I can help. I pull out of the gas station and spot him almost immediately so I pull over and offer him a ride. He thanks me and gladly accepts the ride. He smells showered and his clothes are spotless and clean so I'm positive at this point he isn't homeless. 

I ask if he knows where he lives or if he has an address I can take him to. He says he lives only a few blocks away but he can't remember the exact address and just says, ""I'll know the road when I see it."" I drive down the highway in the direction he indicates and strike up a conversation. He can hold a conversation and talks steadily, no slurring or stuttering, and he isn't dozing off so going off my first aid training I don't think he's had a stroke.

We drive for a bit, and he's all, ""Just a little further. It's up this way I know it."" And at this point we're leaving town and are driving towards the next one. My step grandmother has late-stage dementia and I grew up around her slowly losing her memory. My passenger seems to be exhibiting key signs of memory loss and after a bit of driving he still can't tell me where to turn. And having dealt with my grandma, I know people with memory loss can get aggressive if they get upset so I just kept him talking, kept him happy, lock the doors to keep him in the car, and secretly put in the directions to the nearest police station. 

I convince him to come into the police station with me, and explain to the dispatcher behind the counter how I found him. The dispatcher calls the next town's PD to see if anyone has reported him missing. The man knew his name, but that was about it. He says his name is James. An officer comes out and talks to us, quickly realizes he can't get any useful information out of the gentleman and is worried the man may have had a stroke (hence his confusion). They roll medics and then we get a call back from the other PD and his daughter Amy has reported him missing and is on her way to get him. 

Medics arrive, and he has high blood pressure, low blood sugar and his confusion is more noticeable with all the medics around him. But he isn't exhibiting signs of a stroke (no slurred speech, good strong grip, no sagging/paralyzed muscles). We also get some hazy answers from James who says he thinks he may be diabetic and he might take medication to prevent strokes, but he isn't sure. 

Wait a bit for his daughter to arrive, and the poor medics and police officers really don't know how to keep a conversation with someone who has memory loss so I sit by James and talk and make him laugh and generally keep him happy and occupied. James keeps telling me how I'm such a nice young woman for taking care of him and I remind him a lot of his daughter. The officer whose heading the situation gives me a silent look of thanks for keeping James busy. 

His daughter arrives and she looks like she's in her 40s, just barely keeping it together. She's really trying hard not to let her voice crack or have tears of worry spill out. She's so relieved though and can't stop thanking me. I give her a hug (several actually) and tell her where I found him. Apparently he has memory loss but it's in it's early stages and he goes for evening walks before dinner unsupervised because he only walks a couple blocks and comes right back. He's never before wandered off like this. He also does have diabetes and takes medication for strokes he's had in the past. So me finding him when I did likely helped prevent something more serious from happening. 

I could have called the police to do a welfare check and given them a description of the man and hoped he wouldn't wander too far before they found him, but the whole situation took less than 45 minutes and I was able to keep James out of the severe weather and away from other people who might have taken advantage of him, or risk him going into diabetic shock or a stroke without someone being there for him. 

If it had been my step-grandmother, I would have wanted someone with her the whole time to keep her safe and happy and I'm glad I was able to reunite James with his daughter.",0

Won't be able to mod much due to cancer - anyone care to help out moderating this place?,imnotlegolas,"Couple months ago I got diagnosed with cancer and while I am still around, I don't know for how long and can't be as active.

I love this sub and created what it has become today - a place where random acts of kindness stories can be shared. The only issue the sub has is that a lot of scammers/new accounts use the sub to ask for money or even stuff like video games. 

In my time there's been a ton of scammers here trying to take advantage of kind hearted people with super sad stories, which is one reason why we do not allow requests or offers here. Besides the bigger reason being that it's just the wrong sub for it and there are other bigger subs focused on that particular aspect of acts of kindness.

So if there's anyone who is familiar with Reddit's moderating system who can help out removing these type of posts, please leave a comment or shoot me a message. 

Much love and thank you for all the kind stories i've witnessed here over the many years.

Customer with cancer...,uwzerokool,"This was about two years ago...

I did water conditioning for a living and had a service call to this customers house. I walked in and he was telling that his Reverse Osmosis system was leaking and that he disassembled it so it could be cheaper for me to fix... 
(actually its quite the opposite, it actually would take me longer to fix) 

His RO system frame was badly rotted and by removing the hoses, he created more leaks. The system was 19 years old and I explained to him everything... and told him that I would need to rebuild it or replace it. 

Now, our Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems are hand/custom built for each customer... from the membrane type all the way down to the types of filters and order in which the water hits each filter... They cost up to $1400 brand new but last for years.

Back to the customer... 

So I'm talking to him (I like to get to know my customers) and notice oxygen tanks and pill bottles every where and ask him what's up with the medical supplies. He told me he is fighting cancer and him and his wife have been trying to save as much money as possible for her to survive and pay the medical bills incase he didn't make it... (Him and his wife were pushing about late 60s early 70s and she had to go back to working...)

So I told the man to let me take his system back to my shop and see what I could do for him because it would be cheaper for me to work on it there where I have everything in hand. He agreed and I gathered up all the scattered parts and brought his system back to the shop. 

Back at the shop, I showed my co worker the RO system and he kind of laughed and agreed that it was to rotted to fix. So I explained to him what was going on with the customer and we both came to the conclusion that his 10 year warranty on the system was not expired... We grabbed the customers OE design and built him a brand new system, went back to the customers house the next day and installed it. 

When I asked the customer to sign the invoice, he didn't see a price and asked me how much it cost. I told him that it was a manufacturer defect that the RO system just fell apart like that and that there was no charge. 

Him and his wife both teared up and gave me a hug. It was then I found out that they used the RO drinking water to mix some of his medications and were worried that it would cost them an arm and leg to get it fixed. They thanked me a lot and I went on my way.",0
"""Because you donated, it's on the house""",ThatLudibriousReader,"The most heartwarming thing that happened to me lately. I'd just come from a blood donation so the bandage was still on my elbow.

Old lady shared her umbrella with me,notadinosaur216,"It’s raining, I just left church and was running to catch a bus home. I had to cross the road to get to the bus stop so I stood in the rain, impatiently waiting for the zebra crossing light to turn green.

That’s when a random old lady came and held her umbrella up to shield me from the rain. I helped her hold the umbrella and when the crossing light flipped green we crossed the road together before we parted ways.

I was hesitant, but in hindsight I should have been more grateful for her kindness. It may seem small but this really made my day and taught me to care for everyone, including strangers. Thanks for reading guys :)",0
Thank you meat clerk at Kroger,itsrainingpugs,"This past month has been the most financially stressed I have ever been. Last night I had just enough to get two things of ground pork (1.30-1.40) a piece, a can of manwich mix, and 16 oz potato salad mix that I had a coupon for.


Right before I left I realized my bike has been stolen. I’m angry and upset but I still gotta eat so I walk to Kroger. They only had one package of ground pork. I went up to the meat department and asked them if they could please look in the back because that’s all I could afford.


The meat clerk went to the ground beef section, picked up a 10 dollar 2.7lb thing of ground beef! He told me to “put that pork back!” and paid for all of my food out of his own pocket. I thanked him and told him he didn’t have to do that. He may never truly know what it meant to me.",0
What happened today restored my faith in humanity!,Chevchelios79,"I had an appointment this morning which I had to catch a couple of buses to get to. After the appointment I went to a discount supermarket as the appointment was next to a shopping complex and there were a few food items which I needed. I didn't realize that my bank balance was as low as it was due to recent medical expenses, my card was was rejected. I checked with my online banking app to see what my balance was, it was only $7.90 when my shopping total was over $20. I started to take items out of my shopping bag to bring the total down to what my funds would allow and was concerned that the lady next in line behind me for the checkout may be getting annoyed at being held up by me. I noticed the checkout attendant look over at the lady behind me, the lady then said ""it's all good, I'll pay"", she walked passed me to the eftpos terminal and tapped her phone on it, settling my payment. I looked at her almost in tears and said ""you're an angel, you have to give me your number so that I can pay you back"". She replied ""there's no need for that, this is my good deed for the day"". I could barely believe what had just happened, I said to her ""Thanks so much, God bless you"" before leaving.

I never even found out the name of this lovely Lady but what she did just confirmed for me that there are still some really good people around us.",0
Thanks to the bartenders who let the homeless guy hang,The_Late_Greats,"I just got back from a relatively fancy hotel bar in Louisville. There was a homeless man sitting at the bar. Most places would've given that guy a boot before he was two steps in the door. He clearly had some mental-health issues, but he wasn't bothering anyone, so the bartenders served him a water and otherwise treated him like a human being when he sat down.

I wish I could write a Yelp review or email the hotel about this, but I realize not everyone would react positively to it. So I just hope those responsible see this and know how grateful I am for their humanity, or at the least this inspires others to act similarly. Thanks dudes.",0

This may seem small but...,DevCat14,"It meant a lot to me. I was already having a rough day, just one thing after another. I finally got to go on a lunch break and went to get something quick with my boyfriend. We both forgot our money, and didn't realize it until after we sat in line for 20 minutes. So we went home, grabbed our wallets, and just decided to use the mobile pay spot since we were already kind of rushing. The app decided not to work. We hopped back in through the drive-thru. It wasn't that long anymore, but built up quick behind us. Then! A lady decided she was more important than everyone else and skipped the whole line into the other drive-thru as I was about to pull through. My line started to go really quick, letting me to get in before her. I was upset and just wanted my food at this point. I get to the window and hand them my card and they inform me that the people in front of us paid. It changed my entire day around. Thank you random stranger.",0
Today I learned I helped save a guys life without ever knowing it..,CharlottesExHusband,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for a story like this...

A little back story.  I'm 35.  My dad is 71.  I call him every day on the way home from work, and we talk from 10 min to an hour.  This week was the one year anniversary of my little brother overdosing, so things have been a little emotional.  I went to have a few drinks with some guys from work, which I rarely do,  then of course called dad on the way home.  Today was the one year, and tomorrow is my mom's b day which were going to celebrate.  On top of that, my late brothers pit bull (sweetest dog ever, who lives with my parents now) is 16 and in bad health.   My sister is a vet and we're going to put him down tomorrow.   My dad is pretty liberal and was telling me something about Trump going off on a wounded veteran who was considering running for pres (I think that's the gist, don't follow things too closely). 

 In the convo, I'd (admittedly a little buzzed) told my dad that I wish I could've helped my brother, and that I have a friend who's combat wounded and I'd risk it all to beat anybodys ass who blindly talked shit like that, Trump or not.   1 year ago, week 1 of college football.. weeks after brother passing, I'd reached out to friends on Facebook who gave me football tickets to the Bama game that i couldn't afford so I could take my dad (for free, bless friends).  I'd remembered just then that my dad had met this friend with me at a bar before the game.  My dad was getting a little emotional while talking, saying he wish he could've done something different to help my brother.  I told my dad he's my role model, it wasn't his fault, and I wish someday to be half the man he is.   

My dad then gets choked up, and tells me that I am.   I say no,  I'm not.   He then tells me that my marine friend pulled him aside while I was inside the bar buying us another round before the game, they were on the patio.  He said my friend got choked up, gave my dad a hug,  and opened up about how I saved his life.   I was a little confused and was like.. what?  No I never did anything.   My dad tells me he told him about how his humvee hit an IED in  Iraq, he was the only survivor.  FF about a year, he'd just moved to town to start college after his tour was over.  I still remember seeing a guy sitting at the bar I was a regular at by himself.   I went up, introduced myself, and hit it off with him.   We became buddies.. I knew he was a wounded vet, but didn't ever pry into his stories bc I knew they upset him greatly.   We hung out regularly, I introduced him to everybody I knew (mostly bartenders/owners around town), we had a lot of good times.   He told my dad that the night I met him, he was 95% sure he was going to end things.   He cried, hugging my dad, and told him that I saved him,  and he wanted to thank my dad for raising such a kind person to take him in.  I never knew any of this, but between my dad choking up taking about my friend choking up and confiding in him.. man, I've never been hit in the feels so much.   

TL;DR:  be kind.   You may think you're worthless, but your kindness may just be the thing someone else needs to fight the good fight.  I'd never known this (all happened about 10 years ago), until tonight.   You may never find out that you've helped someone.. but if you don't take the opportunity who knows how the story would have went",0
Random acts of kindness on Reddit. Thank you.,Eyesalwaysopened,"Thank you to all the kind people of Reddit who go and do a kind act. You honestly don’t know how amazing that feels and how much it really can brighten someone’s day. 

My dog fell ill and had to be rushed to the ER. The bill was huge and it really put me in a hole. Right now, I was commissioned to write a poem about my pup, and I’m being paid over 10x my asking price. The bill is large, but honestly that act of kindness made me feel like I could overcome this. Gave me motivation to push more and work harder. It made me hopefully. Honestly, it made my week. 

I hope to be able to be able to pay it forward 100 times over someday. Thank you to all you kind strangers.",0

Wasn't sure where to say this,aMayzC,"There's an older woman that lives in my apartment complex that I see around occasionally, and she bums a cigarette every once in a while. She's always thankful, even if we both shouldnt be smoking. Her apartment is 2 doors down from mine on the same floor. Often I hear her and her husband yelling and fighting as I walk by. It actually reminds me my grandparents. 

Its 3:00 AM where I am. A few minutes ago I walked out to head down and smoke. She was knocking on a neighbor's door, but looked and asked if I could help her. A little weary I told her sure. She said that her husband had fallen and he couldn't get up; he had just had surgery. As I walked in saw him laying on the ground in only a tshirt. I asked him if he wanted to stay down or wanted to get up. He had been defecating on himself which she was cleaning. I tried to lift him but he seemed to be in pain. I told his wife I'm not sure if I can do it alone and we might need call someone. ""I don't know who else  to call"". I assumed she did not want to call 911... at least not yet. 

She came and assisted me trying again. I managed to get him in an upright position, sitting down and facing forward. He said he was ready to try and stand again.  I sat on the bed behind him, put my arms under his, and lifted him the best I could. I'm not the strongest guy, and it wasn't easy. Eventually he was high enough to stand. She said she could help him to the bathroom at that point, and I walked out looking back to make sure he was alright. She looked over and said she had it.

I hope they're okay",0
Friend and I got free apples,CactusChan-OwO,"This happened a few years ago, but I was just reminded of it. 

My friend and I had just finished hiking a small mountain near where we lived. It was a very rural area, but it was a pretty popular hike. As we were heading back to the parking lot, we saw a guy sitting outside a stand where he was selling apples. I couldn’t confirm, but it looked like they were his own apples that he’d grown and he’d just finished setting up. 

Anyway, my friend asked, “How much for the apples?” The guy at the stand didn’t say a word — just tossed us an apple apiece. My friend reached for his wallet, but the guy waved it off and smiled. So we got to enjoy a free apple before we got to the car. It was a huge yellow apple, and probably the tastiest one I’ve ever eaten. 

Wherever you are, random apple stand guy, I haven’t forgotten you.",0
Coffee shop employee gave me a free pastry,Shouko-,"I was waiting in a coffee shop for my M1 mentor because we were supposed to meet up.

I decided on a cinnamon roll and when I went up to pay the guy said ""you look really tired, is something up"". And I told him I just started medical school as an M1 and it's been rough so far. When pulled out my card to pay, he said don't worry, it's on us. After leaving I was just crying uncontrollably, I'm struggling so much and idk, I guess that small act of kindness was just too much.",0

Lady gave me a crib for my newborn!,IGiveDumbCompliments,"Forgive me for formatting and spelling errors. I am out of this world exhausted.

 Long story short, I found out I was pregnant right after my ex and I decided to divorce. In already horrible timing, my ex sent our daughter to live with me while homeless, pregnant, and having no idea what to do. I had my son at just 34 weeks pregnant (thank you, kidney stone) and have had next to no time to figure out how to move forward with both kids. 

In an act of desperation, I called a local ministry for prayer. A lady there (we'll call her Angel) not only went past her duty of work, but came to where I'm staying at the moment to deliver a brand new crib! I've thanked her relentlessly, but it still feels like not enough. So out into the Cyber world, thank you, Angel. You know my entire story, you've selflessly helped my little family, and you didn't hesitate once.

Touched and inspired by the help of strangers,PracticingGratitude,"The other night I was biking up a street in Chicago when, for some reason, the cars in front of me were moving very slowly. The road was clear beyond them, so I couldn’t understand why. As I got closer, I saw a woman was running up the street. Then, beyond the cars, it seemed there was a child of maybe 10 or so running side-to-side up the road. I thought this was her mother and she was chasing him.  
I navigated my bike up through the traffic and heard the woman reply to someone, “He’s not mine!” The kid kept running at a slow pace, stopping, looking around, and running again. I thought maybe he was being playful, but no... that wasn't it. The woman followed him for blocks. She got close once, but the kid stayed ahead of her.  
I biked up past the cars, past the kid, and stopped at a corner. The kid was in the intersection. “Hello,” I said, but he didn’t reply. Just kind of looked at me. He then headed off again, and when he approached an intersection, I blocked off the perpendicular street with my bike. At some point, another woman started running after him, too, saying gentle things like, “Hey, buddy.” Finally, the first woman managed to get him onto the sidewalk, and, for a reason I don’t know, the kid decided to sit down. The two women stayed with him as another couple pulled up in their vehicle. The first woman had called the police, but we were up the street now, and one of the two new people called, giving our current location. The two women sat down on the ground with him, asking him questions, offering one of their phones for him to watch YouTube, then offering to count his fingers and his toes with him (which they did). The kid said almost nothing, save for the rare word. One I caught was “happy.”  
He eventually managed to wriggle himself away from the women and started running into a supermarket parking lot. But this time, the women were able to coax him back on the sidewalk without too much trouble.  
The new couple and I stayed with the women on the ground until a police SUV pulled up. One of the two officers radioed in and then told us that the mother was on the way. Eventually, a dark SUV came up to a hard stop behind the police vehicle, and two men and a woman jumped out. The woman was the mother. She walked up to where the other two women were keeping the kid company and, to my surprise, stopped a few feet away from him. She bent down on the sidewalk and talked to him earnestly and gently from the slight distance. I overheard one of the now-several officers say that the dad was on the way. I heard him say that the child was at a family gathering, and apparently there was too much commotion… too many relatives… and I guess it was too much for the kid. At some point in all this, one of the officers said the obvious, which was that the kid had autism.  
The couple and then one of the women started to disperse. An officer began thanking them. He said the other obvious thing, which was that the kid was lucky, because he could have run into traffic and gotten hit.  
I never learned the names of those two strong, caring women. I’m not sure they even exchanged contact information with each other. The mother thanked them but then walked away to the SUV with the kid in tow, I don’t think ever learning their names, either.  
This story will never make the news. None of those four people will ever get public recognition for what they did; they probably wouldn’t even want it. It was just acts of goodness and luck coming together between the kid and well-meaning strangers.  
To those two women: You inspire me. You remind me that humanity is fundamentally good. You make me want to do more to help the world.",0
I prevented someone getting a fine,Volloz,"Today I was sitting in a tourist train in the square of the beautiful town of Cochem in Germany, waiting to leave, when I noticed a motorcyclist park his bike under a huge sign that said that motorcycles weren't allow to park there. He clearly didn't see it and wandered of right past my carriage. There were people standing next to him that saw the sign but chose to ignore him instead of making a tiny bit of effort and brightening someone's day by preventing a fine. So I hung out of the window and called him to bring the sign to his attention.",0
A Homeless Man Reminded Me,mtimbuck2,"On my way home today, I drove under a bridge downtown. I spotted a homeless man under there. Not asking for money, not sleeping. He was sweeping. Around his made-up bed and his sleeping dog. Around a little table with a globe on top. I don’t know how this man got to be in his situation, but I was inspired by him. He was bettering himself in a small way. He didn’t have a lot, but he was making the most of what he did have. It occurred to me how often we take things for granted and how easy it is for us to complain about things that we won’t even remember tomorrow. Life isn’t about being rich, popular, well educated. It’s about being real, being humble, and being kind. It’s about loving yourself in any season or situation you may be in, and making little strides each day to better yourself.",0

I gave away my skateboard,Volloz,When I was younger I tried skateboarding. My board ended up in the shed because of the lack of good spots to practice and me finding my Xbox more interesting. It was in good shape and just sat there nice and dry for a couple of years completely forgotten. Until driving around enjoying my Miata I came across a new little skatepark with two kiddos practicing. I noticed only one had a board and the other one was just standing there waiting for his turn. My old board popped into my head and I rushed back home to get it and hopefully be back before they had left. I/He was lucky because I gave the kid my skateboard and wished him good luck with it. My reaction was at first bittersweet because he was suspicious until he saw that I meant it. It made such an impact on me that I'll never forget it and hopefully he'll do the same for someone else :),0
"Thank you, random lady. I could never repay you for your kindness. W",katrina34,"I have PTSD among other mental illnesses, so I tend to take my dog with me everywhere. I get too lonely and that lonesomeness becomes depression. Today I took Astro (my doggo) with me on my errands. I went to Aldi, (as per usual) and roll down all the windows and park in a shady spot right by a patch of land. Now my doggo is rather large, probably around 50 pounds. He's bigger than the average ""medium-sized dog"" but too small to be a large dog. I try to be quick in the store, to avoid him getting too hot and whatnot. I always am less than ten minutes, mostly around five, though. When I come back to my car, (to my horror) a lady two cars away from mine sits on her passenger side door with it open, and is holding my dog by the leash as he lays, panting on the asphalt. 

&#x200B;

I fear the worst for my pupper, as I've heard many Karen stories of people thinking they can just take someone's dog. She sees the look on my face and knows Astro belongs to me. (RL random lady) She was short and fairly overweight, probably in her 40s or 50s, which made this even more incredible and kind of her considering how large my dog is. I think she may have been physically disabled.

RL: Do you want your dog back?

Me: Yes! Oh my gosh, Astro! What happened?

RL: What was his name?

Me: Astro. What's going on?

RL: Well you left all the windows to your car open, and your dog apparently needed to go potty and jumped out the window to do his buisness!

Me: I am \*so\* sorry! Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

RL: I saw him do this and he was headed for traffic and I couldn't let him do that. 

Me: I can't thank you enough, ma'am. I'm so sorry for your trouble!

RL: It wasn't easy for me, but I stepped on his leash and sat here and waited. He nearly knocked me down! He's one strong dog!

Me: (Probably continuing to apologize and thank her.)

RL: Oh, it's okay. I know it's hot and you want your dog to stay cool, but you left your doors unlocked, your phone in there, I could have taken everything!

Me: I know, I just wanted him to stay cool!

RL: It's quite alright, I had a wolf husky die about 2 years ago, so I know what it's like to love a dog.

Me: I'm so sorry to hear that! There's a shelter nearby if you'd ever like to adopt.

RL: Oh, I know, honey. I just don't have the strength to take on a dog anymore. I live on the second floor of an apartment and I also have a cat. 

Me: I can't thank you enough, ma'am. I am so sorry for your troubles.

If you're out there random lady, I can't thank you enough for saving my dog, and my entire family the tragedy of his death or losing him forever. Thank you. So much.",0

Shopper helps me out,Pian0vania,"This just happened 5 minutes ago, I am still walking around with a smile. :)

So I volunteer at a small cat shelter, located inside my local PetSmart. I was bringing a huge bin of cat food for the cats inside a small room with cat cages. 
The door to the room is heavy and often gets stuck, requiring for me to tug it a few times to get it open. 
So I have the bin in my hands and the door is obviously locked, thus I have to insert and turn a key and meanwhile keeping the key turned open the door.
I was struggling to do it with the huge bin of food and a random passerby shopper walks by and as soon as he sees me, he immediately drops what he was doing and rushes in to help.

Shopper: “Oh let me hold that box for you.”

He takes the bin from my hands meanwhile I open the door.

Me: “Thank you so much.”

Shopper: “Mom raised a gentleman.”
He smiles and hands me the food bin. “Have a great day!”

Me: “You too! Thank you so much.”

I was a little bit surprised, nevertheless I walked in happy. A random act of kindness :)",0

My neighbor buzzed me in at 3:30AM,rachelnessxo,"So I’m taking care of my dogs while my mom is away on a cruise, and OF COURSE they never wake her up in the middle of the night to go out, but they do to me! Multiple times!

One of the dogs starts doing the little bark thing, so I take them out. I live on a third floor condo in a locked building. Triple checked to make sure I had my keys. I did. But when we got back to the door to come back upstairs, my key wasn’t going into the lock? Weird. After about a minute of trying, I realize someone’s key had broken off in the lock. And the door was shut tight, locked. Half crying, I tried to use my key to turn the part of the key that was already inside the lock. No dice.

The dogs start freaking out. We can get buzzed in, but I’m home alone. I had to pick some poor unsuspecting sleeping person to wake up to hopefully save me.

I don’t know any of my neighbors well, so I picked my next door neighbor. He also has a dog. I don’t know much about him other than HES A SAINT because he buzzed me in! I tried to thank him but I guess he had gone back to bed. So I left him a note outside his door and put a textbook in the door downstairs so that wouldn’t happen to anyone else. 

I’m just overwhelmed with emotion because I really thought me and the dogs were gonna have to chill in the car overnight. Now there’s no more sleeping for me tonight. Whew. That was a doozy.",0

They turned me down due to not being on medication for my bipolar disorder.

I get tipped by a 4 year old kid after his parent was rude to me and co-worker.,RedHaze54,"I work for a moving company. As in moving people's belongings from their house, on to a truck, then take the truck to their new house and unload their belongings there. 

At a job I had yesterday, we were moving a single mother and her 4 year old son from an apartment, into the mothers parents house.

When we pack things the first time we have to document damages on items previous to packing them in the truck. 

Example: When packing a office chair we notice a wheel is wobbly or a large scratch on a dresser, document it. 

We do this to avoid insurance claims when the items arrive at the new place where the owner ""doesn't remember"" the damage previous to moving.

So at this job the mom and they grandma (who wasn't there when packing) were bickering about damages, all of which we documented.

This led to them being difficult in the whole process because it slowed us down so they had to pay more (our company charges by hour and we had another job to do that day so we wanted to get this job done). Then they complained about that too.

At the end when my co-worker and I were cleaning up. The 4 year old, came up to me and said: ""I think you did a good job but my mommy doesn't, sorry. But you can have this penny, I found it in my new room!"" Then he hugged my leg and ran away.

It wasn't much but that little act made my whole day, and I'm still happy now.",0
I give away stuffed animals I win at the arcade,AMobOfDucks,"I'm a U.S. Soldier stationed in South Korea. I have a weird schedule that gives me plenty of time off. I'll head down to this arcade where they have a carnival style prize machine. You put a cork inside an air rifle and shoot at 6 support planks of varying width on a moving platform. When all 6 are shot the prize will drop for collection. The trick is that the rifles sights are jacked up so you have to aim a bit away from the plank to actually hit it. I got it figured out so after a few thousand ₩ (a few $) I'll win a prize. I'll wait for a kid to leave the arcade empty handed or see a family walking by and give the stuffed animal away. I don't need the toy and it might make that kid's day better.

""I can't access them madam. I can only see that they came in. It's to protect your confidentiality, that's why only GPs can discuss that with you.""
""OK fine can I make an appointment for my two children?""
""Sure. And what's the appointment for the second one for?""
""Nothing.""
""...But is something hurting the child, for example?""
""It's my confidentiality OKAY.""

On and on and on... by the time I got there I exchanged a glance with the receptionist and said, ""Wow, she was a piece of work!""
She looked so relieved and said, ""Was it me?? Was I being rude?""
""No, DEFINITELY her. I was getting stressed just listening to her!""

Reassured her a lot. Later when my appointment was finished she looked so happy to see me I received a royal VIP treatment for my follow-up GP appointment. Lots of compliments followed by ""I just want to say that you really made my day, it helped a lot after that lady upset me. I hope you have a wonderful weekend my darling.""

Cue warm, fuzzy feelings 🥰

It's amazing how validation from a stranger can change your mood after someone's been horrible to you!

TL;DR: Patient in front of me was rude to receptionist, made receptionist’s day by validating the rudness and being nice to her.",0

Random Dinner with my Ex Changed My Life Outlook Forever,Mhans_92,"Hello Redditor's, 

&#x200B;

This is my first time really posting an actual personal story on here, (I don't know the many rules/regulation & red tape so I apologize in advance if I break them. 

&#x200B;

This is a bit of a long story but TLDR is this, a stranger payed for my entire anniversary dinner for me and my ex because he was so moved by the love that we shared and could tell we were decent people by what we talked about. His one request was to pay it forward to someone else one day, because kindness always wins. 

&#x200B;

I want to tell a story of a random encounter that changed my outlook on life forever, this night will forever be seared into my brain for as long as I live. I also want to preface by saying that these type's of things, generally do not happen to me.

&#x200B;

Before I get into the specifics of that night, I want to present a bit of a backstory here. 

&#x200B;

I dated my ex GF from 2010 to 2012. We were the standard couple that would go out, have fun, go to movies, out to dinner, adventures and things of that nature. We were pretty good together and overall didn't fight too much etc, things of that nature. The reason I am saying this is because it gives context to the later part of this story.

&#x200B;

For our anniversary I decided to take her to a franchised Italian restaurant that we both liked called Carrabba's ,they are about as popular as Olive Garden in the DMV area. Anyway, the night we went there I had called ahead of time to make sure that there was plenty of space available and that I wanted to make sure that the night was special. I am a little bit of an old school romantic so I picked her up from her place and drove us over to the restaurant. We got there and overall there was not very many people that were eating in, the server found us a quiet spot in the corner away from the main door and kitchen so that we could talk and not be interrupted. There was a table that was across from us maybe 20 feet with an older couple (Who we assumed were a couple, based on their interactions). A few other families at the tables to our left and right and one in the corner. Overall a pretty quiet ambiance. 

&#x200B;

Me and her began talking, catching up on how the day and the week had been for both of us. I don't remember the specifics of the conversation, but I am sure it probably had to do with how how we missed each other, loved each other, plans for the future and things of that nature which I won't bore you all too much with the details. Anyways, we got our food and ate there, if you ever get the chance and are in the Maryland/Virginia area, please check out  Carrabba's  they have some of the best chicken Parmesan that I've had before, great bread sticks and appetizers, but back on track haha.  

&#x200B;

We must have stayed for a few hours that I recall, because it was dark when we were finished eating. I think we had a few drinks and ordered some dessert as well because we didn't leave right away. Maybe about 20 minutes had passed or so and we were packing up getting ready to leave, she grabbed her purse and I got my jacket. I motioned for the server to come to our table. I thanked her for her attentive service and asked for the check. She went back to the front and came back with a puzzled look on her face. She said that it had already been payed for. I told her that this was clearly a mistake as I had not gone up to pay, neither had my GF at the time. She went to get the other server assigned to that area and she came back and explained what forever changed my view on giving back. 

&#x200B;

She told me that the older gentlemen and his wife (mentioned earlier in the story) had taken care of our entire bill....This check was over $120 dollars as we had gotten appetizers, entree's, alcoholic drinks and dessert for each of us. I couldn't believe it (Still can't to this day) I told her that she had to have been joking, she assured that she was not.

&#x200B;

The server told me that the older man said to her, he had never in so many years seen such a genuine love and affection between two people that he could tell were kind and caring, the only request that he had was that one day he expected me to do this same for someone else that deserved it as his goal was to pick a random couple to pay for. 

&#x200B;

I was shook...my mouth to the floor, I could not believe that a complete stranger had done that for me and her. I looked around frantically in my attempt to thank him, but I was crushed to find out that he and his wife had already left.

&#x200B;

I asked the server if she could provide me with his first and last name on his check to contact him but he had payed in cash....

&#x200B;

Still to this day, I wish I could thank that kind man and his wife for what they did. It humbled me to know end to think that someone did that to me, and thought that I was worthy of that love.

&#x200B;

As you can see with the post, we are no longer together but the lesson and memory remains with me nonetheless.

&#x200B;

The promise I made to myself I will always keep and hope that one day soon I can fulfill what he asked, as I have started to finally be in a financial position to do something of that magnitude.  The words he left with the server for me and her to remember were this....

  
Kindness always wins.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time reading this.

&#x200B;

Remember, we are all in this together and no one makes it out of it alive so let's make our time on this earth a little more enjoyable and be kind to one another and share these random act's of kindness anytime we can.",0
Girl sits with me for 3 hours while I cried on her shoulder.,callanfx,"Since I found this sub reddit, all I can think about is this girl and I have been desperately trying to find her since this came back to me! This was in October 2017, I do feel horrible for not making an effort to find her earlier than this but a lot had happened that blocked the WHOLE thing out.. I just wanted to share her kindness. I don't even know her NAME.

&#x200B;

I had been dating then bf for that year, he moved to another college about 45 min away and I thought everything was going great. I was about to visit him for the weekend to celebrate halloween and his birthday when he visited me at the community college I went to about 3 days before I was to see him. I of course was ecstatic before it turned to horror as he admitted to cheating, lying to me for months, ""there's another girl"", the whole 9 yards. My world shattered in an instant, any breakup is hard, especially when I was so completely blind sided. No red flags, in love, (lemme barf in my mouth as I'm remembering this), literally the NIGHT BEFORE we were on a phone call and he was telling me how much he loved me then dropped all this on me... I did end up breaking his nose. (i know i KNOW i shouldn't have, but I don't feel bad)

The worst is that he dropped all this on me in a big parking lot, dead of day, got in his car and drove off. I was a total mess and just crumpled to the ground in the blazing hot parking lot, absolutely balling my eyes out. I honestly have no clue how long I was sitting there (Off to one side of lot so not in the way of cars) when this girl walks up. I guess her car was parked near by when she saw me, she came up and sat right on the ground with me.

She asked if I was physically hurt and when I said no, she pulled me into her arms and just held me. She must have held me for close to 2 hours before I finally got hold of myself to pick myself up a little. She cleaned up my face and sat with me for another hour while talking to me about her day to get my mind off things. At one point she had asked what happened and listened to me absolutely lose it again as I try to explain while she stroked my hair away, never once pushing or looking annoyed. She talked to me about her relationship, their ups and downs, how they got through hard times, how they've been relearning each other, and pointed to her car where her boyfriend had been quietly sitting the ENTIRE TIME. I was shocked to see him there, he had been quietly keeping an eye on both of us to make sure we were safe, but never tried to hurry us along. Never once did either of them complain, but he let her do her thing and helped a stranger in need. We sat for longer until she got me laughing at something stupid, we shared some chewy bar, and when she saw I held myself together to atleast get home safely, she gave me a water, a really big hug, and went on her way.

I HATE that I never even got her name or a number, I literally only saw her 1x in passing at the local mall months later. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was the same girl until too late and was at a time I couldn't go back to find her. I think I remember where she DID work (part of the conversation in the parking lot), so I plan on kinda calling around to see what I can find out. This girl helped me SO much more than she could know, gave me advice and was THERE when I felt like the ground was ripped beneath me. I want her to know how much her kindness met, that I am the happiest I've ever been. I met an absolutely amazing man that I'm engaged to and is the best thing to ever happen to me. He treats me like the princess I'm not and we have 2 little puppies that we spoil the heck out of.

My best friend doesn't know it's me buying her favorite guitar today.,your_memequeen,"My best friends family is in a really bad spot. They just moved into a new house and her mom and all of her sisters have to leave. 

She is tye second oldest and has to sell a bunch of her stuff to help out her mom. One of the things she is having to sell is her bass. One that I know she loves and told me it would be the hardest to give away. So after she called me explaing what was going on I talked to my family and we decided that we would buy the bass and keep it here with me until she could have somewhere to keep it.

She thinks one of my friends is coming with me to pick it up. She has no idea that it's going to be me and my aunt who show up in a few hours. 
I wish I could do more but I'm excited to see her face when she realizes that her guitar is going to be waiting for her and isn't gone forever.


EDIT: Just picked up the Bass. She was very happy to see me and when I told her I would hold onto it until she could take it again she was deffently holding back tears. I'm glad I could help somehow even if it wasn't a lot.

EDIT 2: I hope I don't come off as this stuck up person. I just thought I would post a feel good story. It made me feel good knowing that I helped someone I care about dearly.

EDIT 3: Thank you for the Gold whoever you are!! I'll try to keep this all up to date. I'm planning on buying more of her stuff (some of her cds and stuff) keep you all updated when I can!",0

You wanna know what she did? On the back of one of the girls' bathroom stalls, she wrote ""Hi!!...

To My English Teacher My Junior Year,SilverGriffin01,"Mrs. H

I'm sorry how everyone treated you, Mrs. H. We all had a tough time with your strictness, the amount of homework, what was on the homework, the due dates for assignments, but above all that we misjudged you. I am sorry the other staff weren't really standing up for you and trying to be your friend with such a good connection as some teachers did. You quit at the end of my Junior year of high school and I never got to tell you where all those notes each day came from before spring break(, or was it winter break? I can't exactly remember but I remember that it was before a break). I was trying to change my perspective of you when everyone was being so cruel, I had been like them before I really tried to change my perspective and see how much you were teaching me. I made an effort to make good notes, thoughtful ones to you. I felt that those days when I would give you the notes, you were happier. I also felt like I learned so much during those days. I stopped because I forgot to make notes, I meant what I said in each note, the main one I remember writing was about the symbolism and color themes of Great Gatsby. I love the Great Gatsby thanks to you :) I also love Macbeth. I don't like Catcher in the Rye but that may have been because I didn't actually finish it 😅 sorry. I can't remember the first book we had assigned but I believe I liked it.

I had gotten Senioritis my Junior year so that was why many of my assignments were half hearted, I apologize for that as well. I still enjoyed your class very much, I wish I had had the courage the last day of school to tell you it was me who gave you the notes. I'm sorry for joining the crowd of bad mouthers in the beginning of the school year, initially when I first heard about you when I was a Freshman, I didn't believe the Sophmores of my Biology class that had had you the previous year and were still bad mouthing you. I had decided to not pass judgement yet because I didn't believe in how strict and set in stone your work was. I wanted to see it for myself but honestly, I had hoped to not get you my Junior year. Me being in your class taught me a great lesson, show kindness even if it is difficult and everyone has their own problems they are going through. I didn't see those problems as quick.

I am still all over the place as my essays and include too much quotation. I try not to have too much quotation in my learning now, I know that I would include sentence after sentence of quotation but I felt that all of it was important quotations even if it was a whole paragraph. I focus on detail but can't make much details for myself, including in the story outlines I had wanted to share with you, I would write stories when we had our laptops out and I had down time, sorry but my brain is just a tornado of debris throwing information at me all at once. That is why my writing is so erratic. I had wanted to share my ideas, my stories I was working on at the time but I couldn't do it.

I remember you had us write in our agendas everyday, I honestly eventually stopped writing in it. You made an effort of teaching us, I'm sorry that I was a coward and not brave enough to tell you myself how great a teacher you were to me. 
I would unintentionally turn things in late to the online assignment collector thing, I forget what it's called but it made sure we weren't plagiarizing and such. I never plagiarized but I would turn things in late and I came in a couple of times to turn them in and/or ask for you to open the assignment collector for me again. Thank you for helping me both times.

I guess what am trying to surmount is that I am sorry for how I treated you and anyone else may have treated you. I wanted to make amends and make it known that I made the notes to make you feel better, not for my own pleasure, I wanted to show that I did appreciate your teaching. I had finished the week with a big thank you I left on your door and my Latin teacher's door, I was putting them up with a couple of friends of mine, while you were still in your classroom after school, one of my friends' being in your class as well, we were in the same period. We put them up trying not to make a ruckus but one of the older security guys on campus was demanding us to leave, being loud when we were trying to be discreet. He had told me I had to leave earlier but I was trying to make you and Magistra a Spring Break ""Heart Attack."" Well I hope you enjoyed the ""Heart Attack"" and didn't see it as a nuisance. I loved making it for you putting more little notes on them as well. I truely did enjoy your class and I am happy I was in your class. I feel that in the the worst of adversity you grow the most, I hope that after all the oppression of teaching, you left behind but won't forget, will help you see a better time to come.

Thank you, Mrs. H

A doctor paid for my breakfast this morning,DaphosActually,"Im a 17 year old student enrolled in the ITLS in Hong Kong. This morning planned to have breakfast at a McDonald's and then study for my exams for the rest of the day in the library. 

I got to the front of the line and I made the realisation that I didnt bring my wallet down with me. I panicked a bit and fumbled through all the loose change that I had on me and dropped a bunch on the floor, so I just told the cashier to cancel my order, having decided I wasnt gonna have breakfast today.

Then a lady behind me suddenly offers to pay for my meal. I told her that I couldn't accept her offer and that I had just left my wallet at home but she insisted anyway and tapped her card onto the card reader. Later she told me that she was a doctor at a local hospital and she saw that I had an ITLS textbook with me and thought she could help out someone going into her field. Later she also asked if I had enough money to take the bus home. 

Not really sure how I should end this off but this random act of kindness really made my day! :)",0

"Even ""Small"" Gestures Restore Belief in Humanity",ixxaria,"Sorry long post but TL;DR at end.

I am going through a particularly rough chapter in my life (got cancer, in middle of chemotherapy) and there are definitely days that are rougher than any before in my life.

There are people who make you question their existence on this planet (talking to the guy who came down a one way lane in a parking lot to cut me off for the space I was about to pull into). 

Then there are the ones, who in a moment, with a small unexpected gesture replace every negative feeling you have for humanity.  I never expect anything from anyone else as everyone works hard for their existence.  So when someone gives something, it should be acknowledged and appreciated.  

This happened at a local shaved ice place.  I was having a difficult day as my digestive system didn't want to deal with food, side effects were out of control.  I walked in knowing that, yeah sugar coated ice probably not the best on the list, but if that was what my stomach was going to accept; shaved ice was it was getting.  

The young lady behind the counter asked me how my day was and I told her better now that I was there.  I lamented how I didn't understand some people and their actions.  My scarf came off my bald head and seeing her reaction I explained I am going through chemo, that is why I was there cuz my stomach was ok with shaved iced.  I gave her my order and she gave me a total that was $4 less than usual.  I said I was sorry I thought I said large and she said yes I did and I notice now there is a VIP discount.  I say I totally don't need a discount to which she tells me, ""when we work 30 hours we earn one of these discounts and I rarely use mine and you sound like you can use it today."" I thanked her and put all the money I would have spent plus the tip I was going to give into the tip jar.  She hands me my syrup drenched ice and tells me she will look forward to seeing me again.

Not going to lie, once I got into my car I sat there and cried for a good 10 minutes.  All because this complete stranger gave me a discount she works hard to earn and took a horrible day and made it into a memory of kindness I won't ever forget.

TL;DR -  Had a difficult day and went for shaved ice, young lady employee there uses discount she earns for hours worked on me, restores belief in good people in world.",0
So I was on my way to the Emergency Vet...,Animalgirlmep,"I was on my way to the Emergency Vet with my mom. We had a kitten (I’m just gonna say now that she didn’t make it, I don’t want this to come as a surprise later) who we were taking there. She was fading, but still breathing. There was a Starbucks on the way and my mom and I were both going to fall asleep if we didn’t have any coffee (it was like 10-11:00 ish) so we stopped quickly by it. The woman at the window was very nice and was giving us our drinks when I pulled the kitten out of her carrier to check on her. The woman looks at the kitten and literally almost starts sobbing. She explained that first my mom’s name reminded her of a song from her childhood, and then that the kitten was the tiniest kitten she’d ever seen in her life. We talked for about 2 minutes (would have been longer but we had to get to the vet). She said she was praying for us, and she was one of the nicest people I’ve ever met at a drive thru. After the kitten passed away, we were really sad but it was nice to know she made one last person happy. 
I’ll never forget how nice that woman was. I still think about it sometimes and I hope she’s doing well. Kindness is important. ❤️",0
Good luck rewards a good boy!,GlyntTheCat,"Hello everyone!
First time posting on reddit and I'm sure that it's good for your souls to read this story. I apologise in advance for any errors, grammatical or spelling wise, having a mobile phone and all. Onwards to the  reason you're here. TL;DR at the end. 

Backstory! 
From my childhood to the young adult phase, me and my family (sister, mother & grandparents) would have time in the summer to go on holiday. We went to three separate holiday parks across two locations in this time frame, all of which were in the country England. 

One thing that I enjoyed doing as a rather sheltered individual was playing video games, imagine my joy when every year I went to a holiday park, there were some things to enjoy at the arcade! Time Crisis, Sega Rally, DDR, Silent Scope, House of the Dead, even some Initial D! (Not bragging, that was my main squeeze) The arcade was one great source of joy from my time on holiday and if I was good enough at a certain game, I made it my goal to fill the leaderboards with my name.

Later on in this period of time, it was decided that we'd change our holiday destination to one that was much closer. This was to help my poor grandfather who was the only person capable of driving us to the destination, since grandmother wasn't good with long distance driving and mother was heavily inexperienced as a driver despite having a licence.

The Yorkshire Coast greeted us in all its gorgeous allure. The road leading to that holiday park filled me with a light anticipation upon seeing that lovely coastside. We made it to the holiday park outside of Filey (a small coastal town) and it was massive! Each area had a name, like a road name would.

There were many things to do at this holiday park, kart hire, laser battle, funfair, swimming, the beach, archery and more! I wish I could say that I enjoyed the arcade though, but the majority of the arcade games were ticket machines and the arcade games available were less than memorable imo (NASCAR in the UK? oof). Nevertheless, I got what I could from this arcade, I do enjoy time with my family but every now and then I'd like to have some time to myself.

Cue the goodness!

One day, I decided to enjoy whatever I wanted to do one evening. I picked a few machines, got a few tickets but one thing stuck out at me for some reason. The Ticket Roulette Wheel.
You stick money in and you then spin the wheel yourself to get a ticket prize. A simple game of chance? Why not! So I stuck money into that machine and spun it. I kid you not when I say that in MY VERY FIRST SPIN, I somehow landed the needle on the one area that rewarded the maximum prize, 1,000 Tickets!

I was gobsmacked by this insane show of luck, people stopped to watch in disbelief of this long mass of tickets being spewed out as reward for my good show of luck. I even posted a vine showing off this feat of chance (RIP Vine).

So there I was with over a thousand tickets in hand due to this and my previous prizes pondering what to do next. I went through the options in my head.
""No, I won't redeem them, I wouldn't get a good prize with this much and nothing at the prize booth interests me enough to start saving tickets.""

Then it clicked, let's give all these tickets away to a random kid. I was looking for children specifically who were holding tickets or playing around the ticket machines. Then I saw a young boy, about 7.
I give him a tap on his shoulder with the tickets.
He turned around to which I said ""Hey kid, do you want these tickets?""

I cannot put a price on that boy's face but if I could compare it to something, it'd be like I literally gave this boy the keys to Disneyland! The immense joyful shock lining his still developing face will be a memory that I will take with me to the grave as I handed over the prize to this now lucky child.
""Enjoy your holiday"" I said as I smiled and walked away filled with joy for the actions that I had done that day. 

You think that'd be the end of this tale?
Years later after this tale took place though, I discovered another chapter to this tale. Being a complete stranger that gave away a thousand tickets made me very recognisable. So I was observed, enjoying the time with my family at a table during bingo (UK holidays are wild) but they were approached while I was away. The conversation went as follows.

S = sis / Bm = Boys Mother

Bm: Um excuse?
S: Hmm?
Bm: Is it possible that you know a tall guy with long hair? 
S: Was he stocky?
Bm: Yes he was.
S: Yes I think that's my brother.
Bm: Could you tell him thank you?
S: What for? 
Bm: He decided to give my son all the tickets he won  in the arcade, he was saving up his tickets for a toy he really wanted and all those tickets he was given were enough for him to buy it, it has really made his holiday.

And that's that! Years after I did a random good deed, I'm reminded of it and feel that little bubbling joy of one action showing that I am a good person. 

I never saw that happy boy again but his joy will stay with me for my entire life! I hope he has a good life, he certainly deserves it! Be kind to each other and be well! 

TL;DR Arcade lover on holiday wins a lot of tickets, gives them away to a random boy and makes him happy!",0

She asked if she could take a photo of him wearing a pair and he said sure. All he asked in exchange was a hug. Sorta creepy but also maybe this’ll help her sell some!,whosurdaddy15,,0
Finding a New Home,ThatGirlWithTheBow,"Seeing all the parents coming through at work spending hundreds on Easter baskets this year inspired us to downsize the stuffie family so that kids visiting the pantry boxes to get supplies for Easter dinner would have a special guest to bring along. Attached a handwritten note to each and didn't expect much, but in less than 48 hours, already three of our friends have been adopted. Thank you kind strangers for giving a new love to our stuffed companions!

Random act if food.,Cyanidesuicideml,"I saw a lovely elderly lady and I am guessing her son today in a steak and shake. I'm trying to teach my son about kindness especially to the elderly and the disabled. 


   The son cut up his moms plate of chili spaghetti and my son pointed it out.  Loudly. The woman was very nice and told him her hands were not as strong as they used to be, and didn't his mommy and daddy cut his food? My son answered yes, and said he Hope's her hands feel better lol and told them one day he will do it for me since I have ""bar itis"" ( arthritis) ! . I bought their meal, I hope it makes them smile! 

 But wait! Theres more! I explained that sometimes it is nice to just do nice things for people, and about 10 minutes ago my son brought me the entire bag of oranges.... and offered to peel me some! I'm proud of him, though I explained I can still do it!",0
Random act of kindness in a BUS!!,SamEyzz47,"So, today I was riding the bus home (it was PACKED), when at one bus stop when the doors started to close, some boy I have never seen before loudly said: I need to get off! He tried to get to the door but couldn't in the full bus and at that point the bus started to move. (Keep in mind: He looked around 9-10 years old) I remembered one time I forgot to get off the bus and freaked out so my instant reflex was to scream to the front of the bus: Stop the bus, and open the door! The bus stopped again and the boy got off. No thank you from anyone, but now I got a nice story to tell!",0

A great kindness was done this day,trickstersgambit,"I had an appointment with an oral surgeon, today. Since my partner and I don't own a car, it meant public transit and some walking, through the heat of the day. Roughly half an hour of it in total. We, in our brilliance, forgot to bring water bottles. So on our return trip, we ducked into a Denny's  for water. We each had one of the freebies, and asked for a no-go cup. They're one dollar there, I had one dollar and some cents in my account. It should have been fine.

My card was declined. Cue the pair of us frantically searching our bags for any sort of coin that could add up to that needed dollar, me nearly in tears, embarrassed to have my card declined, for a dollar of all things.

Then my personal hero stepped in.

""You can have this"" she said, offering me a ten

""I'm. Are you sure? I can give you back the change...""

""No. Keep it. You'll need it""

Are you psychic, ma'am? Did you somehow know we were out of eggs? Who are you? How do I thank you? I hope your day is filled with peace and comfort. I hope your favorite food is on sale at the grocery store. I hope you find the grocery cart that doesn't squeal or pull to one side. I hope every time you do your eyeliner it's the perfect flick.

A RAC from my elementary school.,scaretAngel,"This is something I don't remember nearly as often as I should. Sorry it's long, but it's definitely worth it. Tldr at bottom

I was a kid in elementary school, my brother, and I were “latchkey children” aka, we would go home and we'd be alone for a few hours until my father got off work and could come home, sometimes this was not until late at night. There was an older, retired lady that lived in front of us and kind of kept an eye on us. It was a neighborhood of families and friends of families. We even had a farm a few spaces away, literally next door to the mobile home property, this is a bit of a tangent. 

Tangent aside, I heard a knock on the back door. One of those firm, athoritative knocks you get from police officers and public service officials. This was back in the days of pagers and house phones, so I have my brother paging our father while I peep out of the back door, balanced on the washer. (our back door was also the wash-room.) 

It's my principal, my school counselor, and one or two teachers. I am confused. I get down and answer the door. I know I'm not supposed to let anyone in the house, but it's the school, it's cold, and the house is clean... (mostly) 

I ask why they are there, the counselor says they're there to deliver something, and can they come in, it's awfully cold. This man has my absolute trust. I let them in. They come in see we already have our Christmas tree up, and they're talking to me and my brother about it. We're proudly showing off the home-made decorations, and I offer to make some coffee. They decline. While they were keeping our attention, the teachers had gone back to the school transport van, and were bringing in presents wrapped already with big, pretty bows, and food. (we didn't have any, my dad was going to go grocery shopping in a few days when he got paid, I often skipped meals when we were out of school because we just didn't have food. I still squirrel away food and I'm 30...) 

So they bring in all of Christmas break's worth of groceries and then some. I'm crying, hugging the counselor, then my teachers, then the principal. They left, and my dad came home. Maybe 10 minutes apart. He yells and curses and basically pitches a huge fit because we weren't supposed to allow people in the house, and that he was embarrassed because people were providing for his kids instead of him struggling to provide for us. It hit him hard, pride-wise. 

But that year we got clothes that fit, food to eat without needing more than a microwave, other than Christmas dinner, and the memory of these people who barely knew me and my brother except for at school other than my counselor, who gave of themselves in a place that teachers didn't truly make a living wage. A lesson in kindness that I try to perpetuate.

TLDR: the school counselor, principal, and some teachers came to our home and delivered food and clothes and shoes, all this from their own pockets. Dad wasn't happy, but we had a wonderful Christmas",0
A surprising act of kindness at Target!,SpectrumMommy_Amylee,"This is short and sweet!  
So my son and I went to our local Target today because they had some of the foods that I needed on sale. All through the store my son (who has severe autism) was on his BEST behavior 📷:) We finish picking out all our necessities like water, frozen pizza, juice etc.. So we get to the self serve checkout line and a random tall,dark, and handsome man randomly walked over to me and says""You look like you need this"" he smiled and handed me a $20 gift card! I was totally stunned and turned to say thank you so much and he was walking out the front door. The cashier saw the interaction and said ""did you want me to check to make sure its valid?"" I said umm sure! Sure enough it was valid! So I was able to get my basic necessities for my son and I for the week 📷:) I dont know if the guy who gave me the card will ever get this message but I just want to THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart! You totally made my week!",0
Taught my kids to do random acts of kindness,Anonymous0212,"When my kids were still fairly young I came across a list of random acts of kindness that people could do. One that we did occasionally was bring a small pile of dollar bills to the library and leave one bill each inside a bunch of children’s books. But the main one was that on Wednesdays after my daughter had gymnastics we always stopped at Taco Bell for dinner, and I’d always give the kid at the window an extra dollar toward the meal of the person in the car behind me. Years later my kids said it made an impression on them that I did that.",0
Homeless kid denying food,unicornchunda,"About 2 or 3 months ago my girlfriend and I got some McDonald's at a drive thru.

I was moved by the fact that he would go hungry just so she could finish her meal... I went back and got him a double quarter pounder meal.",0

A local musician/author remembered me and sent me a copy of their new book,liriwave,"I won a Goodreads giveaway back in August of 2016 and ended up loving the book, partly because it all takes place in the exact locations where I live at and around so it made it an extremely vivid and enjoyable story. I wrote to the author to thank them and let them know I enjoyed the book. It was very pleasant.

Last night my son comes home with an envelope that was sent to my old address(his grandma owns the place so she kept it to give it to me) and to my surprise, its this guys new book loaded with stickers and bookmarks! This was probably the nicest random surprise/kindness that has happened to me in a long time. I had to give up 99% of my physical book collection (well over 2,000) when my husband decided to leave, so not having books has been a goal I've been working on fixing as well as a part of my depression in realizing what I've lost.

Thanks Scott! I'll be prioritizing your book for sure as well, and of course, that Goodreads review.",0
Kind sticky notes,emmagfromtn,"My best friend has depression. And sometimes life gets her down. I’m at her dorm right now, and while she’s at work, I’ve placed sticky notes strategically around the living space.

There’s others placed inside of her textbooks that say “you can do this” and “math is tough, but you’re tougher”.  I know it’s not a lot, but when she sees them, I hope they make her day. Because she deserves the world.

"Distressed girl, i hope youre doing ok",hoesoro,"(On mobile)

I work in retail pharmacy and was closing tonight. We close at 11 and it was currently about 10:35-ish. I help one woman and she waits for her prescription to be filled. Behind her, some distance away, i see a young looking girl, probably late teens maybe very early twenties.

My vision is pretty bad so at first i think shes supicious, shes looking around, keeps pacing in a 5 ft radius, ect. We just heard about a robbery at a fellow store earlier that same day and so at first im looking around like is this really about to happen? Thankfully, everything was fine and im just blind.

She comes up to the counter and is holding her ID, her card, and one item. Plan-B. It all comes to me. Shes hiding it so no one can really see. Im also female so I thought maybe she felt more comfortable with me than with the males at the front if the store.

I ask her how can I help her and she starts crying a bit. My heart sank. I swear I felt it drop to the floor. She says, ""Just this."" While holding back tears. I dont know what happened to her. I dont know whats going on in her life right now. All i know is that as a fellow woman, and as someone shes putting her trust into as a pharmacy tech that i have to make her feel at the very least, a little better.

She requests that i take it out of the blister packaging and the box itself, and of course i want to make her feel as comfortable and judgement free as possible. i take it out if the packaging and hold it low and close to me so no one could see accidentally. I double wrap it in bags so she can hide it better, more discreet and no one can see through. She pays with her card after some difficulty to find which button was the credit one and im speaking softly and calmly to her.

She was so upset. So violently upset, i could tell she was crying before coming inside. I tried my best to give her looks with eyes full of sympathy and understanding. I so desperately wanted to hold her hand and tell her whatever it is shes going through is going to be ok. I wanted to come out and give her a hug and tell her its all going to be alright, and that she can get through this, that she is strong. She was so young and so upset, my heart aches for her.

Young lady, i dont know who you are. I dont know whats happened to you or what youve been through to cause you so much strife over this. But i want you to know that wherever you are and whatever you go through i wish the best for you. And i hope everything gets better for you soon. Stay strong, and know there are people out there who care for you, even strangers.

This may not be the biggest random act of kindness, but i felt i needed to tell someone this. To get this off my chest and to voice that i hope with all my heart that shes ok.",0
Thank you to the man who tried to fix my phone!,humdrumblues_,"A few months ago my phone fell into a hot tub and hasn't been working since. The other day I took it into a shop and asked if anything could be done, and was told that diagnostics could be run for £35 and any repair charges would be added onto that. 


I went to pick it up today after work and the man running the shop told me that he had taken it apart, cleaned every part with alcohol, replaced the screen and the battery and charger port but nothing could be done without replacing the motherboard. He said he wouldn't recommend it, as you can buy a second hand phone for about the same price and the repair wouldn't be guaranteed to work.


I got my purse out to pay him for looking into it and he told me he wasn't going to charge me for running the diagnostics on it. Saving the £35 was a relief but the act in itself was appreciated even more.



Thank you for making my Friday a little better, even though my phone isn't salvageable!!!",0
Finding a seat after a long day.,Equestofu,"There are those moments where it's been a long day, you have a lot on your mind. The closest places to eat are either too crowded or too expensive. You've had a heavy conversation with a coworker and are just too tired to eat out. You wander for a while walking along the streets thinking if you are in the right frame of mind to enjoy eating out only to decide on just ordering take out while on the way home. You want to just go home and settle down where its quiet, but you don't want to get a cab cause it's expensive and you want to limit costs. Then it's time for public transport.

Maybe it's the worry or general stress that paints a blank expression on your face. Or your eyes seem to glaze over your surroundings. Then all it takes is that kind stranger that tells you it's alright to take that seat. Or maybe it's just providence that it's open, and you sit down thinking that someone will be eyeing you because you are in business attire.

But then it never comes. Instead it becomes clear that people can sense you've had it rough today. So nobody fights it with you. You lay your head back and just feel thankful for being in a society that just let's you have that one moment of respite. And you just feel thankful for that one open seat and the empathy of the people around you.",0

Sometimes It's The Little Things,JustASimpleLady,"So I work at a paint your own ceramics studio. We have a double door, very big and very heavy, and each door is held onto the building with a hinge at the top and the bottom. We usually only use one side, so we lock the other door and block it with a table so people don't try and use it. About three years ago the landlord remodeled the front of the strip mall we're located in. Ever since then the door has been a problem, as in it will not close the last few inches unless physically pulled. The owner got a few quotes on how much it would cost to fix on her own and she was quoted a few thousand dollars. So she and the landlord had been going back and forth ever since about who was actually responsible for fixing it.

So a few months ago, in the middle of the winter and the cold, we had an extremely busy day. I had a full studio and a birthday party running. I'm in the middle of helping three different customers when suddenly I hear somebody yell. I look up and see someone physically holding up the door because it has broken off its hinges. The only thing still holding it up was the metal bar that makes it close on its own.

I immediately go into crisis management mode. I took a look at the door and tried to move it a little bit but it's very obvious that this is going to be being my very meager handyman skills. I ended up propping the door open so that nobody would get hurt, then jacked up the heat and turned on a few heaters we have around the studio. Then I got to work clearing off the table in front of the other door (the blocked and locked one) so I could try to close the broken door.

I will admit most customers understood that this was not something we could help. But of course you always have the people that are just unhappy with the world. The birthday party was angry and upset because there's a direct path between the door and our party room. Another group was complaining because their daughter had just gotten over being sick. Another group called me over and demanded to know why we can't just close the door. . . When they had literally been there when it had fallen. And the other girls working the floor are in a complete panic and being completely unhelpful at every turn. So I spent the entire day trying to keep people calm, apologizing for something I have no control over, and trying to clear out space and make sure we have a safe door to use, all while STILL being bombarded by customers.

So by the time the owner arrived with her husband and son to help out, I was pretty much just done. At this point the studio is starting to clear out. I went to the register to check people out, of course apologizing for all of the craziness of the day and giving discounts to the worst of the customers because I just was done with that nonsense.

Then an older woman came up to the register. I checked her out, again apologizing for all the craziness. She very calmly asked me if we're allowed to accept tips. I tell her yes we do, and I point to a line on her receipt when we had a gratuity as well as the tip jar that we keep at the front register. She then pulls out a $50 bill from her wallet it puts it directly into my hands. She told me that I'd handled the entire situation really well, especially all the people who she'd seen giving me a hard time, and if done a great job not letting their bad attitudes affect me. Then she left before I could say anything.

I swear to God, I very nearly broke down into tears. After all the crap I had to deal with all day, it was relieving to hear that all the effort hadn't been completely useless. It was a small thing, but that one customer completely made up for all the bad ones.",0
"Reading this sub has reminded me of a person, and I don’t even know his name..",galsfromthedwarf,"I was 22 when I tried to kill myself (not for the first time but the first time in a public place) and a random stranger saved my life. He grabbed me and pulled me back over the railings of an overpass just as I was about to jump.

There’s so much backstory I could give but the essence is that I never thanked him. At the time I was too distraught and upset that someone had stopped me. Over the years Ive thought about the random commuter that saved my life. Some (a lot) of the time I wish he hadn’t stopped me, but on better days I wish I could thank him.

I know it made the local newspaper at the time and it included a picture and his name (I never saw the article) but it’s been several years now and trawling the archives has turned up nothing.

So, from me, thanks dude. I don’t always appreciate what you did but I appreciate that it came from a place of kindness.

Had a trip paid for anonymously,Bavio8891,"For background, I spent some time in the military. While I was stationed on the east coast of the US, I met a girl, and we started dating. We're not together anymore, but we have a beautiful baby boy together. She and I are still on very good terms, so I'm very happy about that. After I got out of the military, I moved back home to the midwest with the plan to move back out east as soon as I save up a bit of money. I didn't make the best financial decisions while in the military, and have racked up a large amount of credit card debt. Nothing unmanageable, but at the point this story occurred, 90% of my paychecks were going to pay for my bills. The other 10% was for gas, food, and giving my mom as much money as I could, since I was now living with her. I felt/feel horrible for not sending my son's mother much money, but do when I can. She's extremely understanding as says just to send what I can when I can, which admittedly, is not much or often. 

I also told her I would do all I could to make regular trips out to see him when I can, but it would involve driving the 13 hours there, since round trip gas in my car is cheaper than a plane ticket. I'm very open about everything I've stated, and have no hesitations telling people as I'm getting to know them, if they ask. I don't like shoving this info down their throats, but I don't hide it either. And it does happen more often than not, as people here in my state are notorious for being friendly and talkative. 

On to the story

When I moved back home, I decided to go to college part time to attempt to earn a degree, which would help finding a job once I got back out east. As an elective, I decided to go with Intro to Theater, as I love performing, and want to learn all I can about theater and be involved with it any way I can, especially if it's for a job. I only mention this class, because I'm 99% sure the person that this story is about met me in that class. 

We often did group work, and in an effort to get to know each other better, we always shared snippets of info about our lives when relevant, and everyone got along really well in that class. One of the students was an older gentleman I'll call 'Tom'. He was auditing the class, and was always eager to learn. Very friendly, open, and loved talking with us 'young people' (I'm a little old for a college freshman at the time, being 28, but I think he was mid 50's, so I had no problem being called young by him). 

I decided to audition for a play the school was putting on, and got the part I wanted, which was great. Another classmate also was cast as the part they wanted, so we made sure to let the class of thespians know people they knew were going to be in a play. 

After the third rehearsal, the director (the teacher of the Intro to Theater class) called me into his office. I had no idea what was going on. I though I may be in trouble for not doing homework, or he thought my performance in these three days had been lackluster or something. Instead, we sit down, and he hands me a blank envelope with something inside. 

I opened it up, and pulled out the letter before reading 'This is to help you get back to your boy. Take the money you would have used, and help make your dream of becoming an actor a reality'. Behind where the note was sat $200. I looked up at my director, completely speechless, thinking that, for some reason, he had decided to give me a gift. 

Before I could speak, he said ""This envelope was left in my mailbox in the office."" I blinked a few times before asking ""By whom?"" He simply shrugged and said ""I have no idea. It was just left with an anonymous note saying to give this to you."" 

I was elated, and yet also guilty. I don't like accepting help, especially when it came in monetary compensation. We mulled it over for about fifteen minutes trying to figure out who would have left the money. All he said was that the person in the office said it was 'An older gentleman'. I didn't think of Tom right away, because there were a lot of older gentlemen I knew from my part time job that I had told this information to. But I came to the realization about five months later that it was probably Tom, as he was the only older gentleman I knew that also knew I was in that play or that I had that professor. 

I know he probably won't ever read this, as I doubt he uses Reddit, but I want people to know that there are still kind people out there willing to help others. So thank you, Tom! You paid for my entire trip with money to spare. If I could thank you in person now or give back the money I didn't use, I would. After the class ended, I haven't seen or heard from him since. ",0
What Goes Around Comes Around :),CordialMusic,"I  was out late, drinking beer with friends at a bar, and I was feeling  euphoric and super generous. My friends eventually leave, and I'm lonely  so I started chatting up randos outside the bar (I get suuuper  talkative after a few drinks). I ended up giving all my money to some  homeless guys and talked with them for a while about politics and their  life-stories. Finally I decide to go home and knock the fuck out 😴  (before I give away my coat or something else my  stupid-drunken-overly-generous self would do), but then I saw this Twink  (maybe 27 years old?) in tears.

He  was walking aimlessly around with tears pouring down his cheeks and  snot running from his nose. I stop to give him a tissue (I carry them  around b/c you never know when you or someone else will need one) & I  asked if he was okay. He broke down, clung to me, and started sobbing.  Which is a weird thing to do to a complete starnger, but I can tell he's  reallllly drunk and just needs a lil help (I've been there). After  crying into my shoulder for a minute he explains that he managed to lose  his phone AND wallet while also forgetting where his hotel was.... he  had been walking around drunkenly for hours in the cold with no coat or  anything, so I take pity on him and look up his hotel on my phone and  it's literally right around the corner (lmao). I kinda went into mother  hen-mode and lead this drunk-ass twink to his hotel.

Now  I am lower-middle class & this hotel lobby just SCREAMED rich.  Fireplaces, many uniformed attendants, beautiful furniture, classy  lighting.... (later I looked it up and one night there costs fucking 500  dollars :O (oh my fucking god)). The Twink immediately starts  complaining to the staff about how he lost his wallet, and how he was  wandering around outside for hours in a t-shirt trying to find the  hotel. He's whining and pouting and obviously inebriated and.... I'm  kinda mortified, b/c I hate wasting employee's time with bullshit, and  he wasn't exactly being nice or considerate to them. But these hotel  workers knew how to deal with the ultra-rich (i.e. ultra-entitled) and  they just nodded and told him exactly what he wanted to hear.... I was  impressed by the staff's incredibly respectful and professional response  to being whined at by a drunken idiot who was just psycho-babbling at  this point.

So by now I had done my  job, he had found the hotel, and I was gonna leave, but to my surprise  he invited me up to his room. I was still buzzed and still kinda worried  about this dumb-ass drunk rich twink, so I shepherded his stumbling ass  upstairs and to his room, and oh my god you guys....

HIS FUCKING ROOM....   like...

I  felt like Shane Dawson reacting to Jeffree Star's mansion. There were  super-high ceilings, a HUGE bed, gorgeous floor to ceiling windows, and a  fucking plate of arranged berries (LET ME REPEAT A CASUAL PLATE OF  ARRANGED BERRIES). We immediately start eating the berries, and started  chatting (aka I listened to him complain about this evening more).  Apparently this dumb twink had taken his friend's PRIVATE FUCKING jet to  get to NY where he then got really drunk in a helicopter ride and  started blacking out. Apparently his friends just left him? Or he  wandered off? The details were fuzzy. We finished all the raspberries  and he started taking off his clothes. I was kinda like... uh ok. This  is weird as hell, but I'm gay and I am not entirely opposed to the  situation. He's in his underwear and decides to draw bath.

I'm  like.... trying to give him his privacy, but he doesn't care at all,  and he's not bad to look at either. Heh ANYWAY, he manages to find his  backup iphone (which apparently he has b/c losing his wallet and phone  are common occurrences for him (lmao what a fucking mess)). So like, he  facetimes his friends and summons an uber. I've been forcing him to  drink water and I can tell he's getting more coherent. THEN this fucker  pulls out some versache bag totally filled with STACKS ON STACKS of 100  dollar bills. I had never seen that many bills before and I'm totally  awestruck, I'm gooped. I'm gagged, and as he counts out 1000 dollars, he  brags about how expensive the bag was (something stupid like 5,000  (....fucking rich people)).

HE THEN HANDS ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS and says ""Thanks for helping me out tonight.""

I  am MOTHERFUCKING shook. My wig? Snatched. My bussy? Quivering. My  pocket? Full of hundred dollar bills. I've never been paid this much at  once before, and I honestly wasn't expecting it at all, but did I  complain? HELL NO LMAO BITCH YOU KNOW I TOOK THAT :P

So  anyway, we go to the club his friends are at and I feel like a street  urchin among models. Everyone is white, thin, tall, and INCREDIBLY well  dressed: they are the queer upper 1% and I feel woefully under-dressed  (mind you I'm lugging around my huge puffy coat, backpack, and my hair  is a fucking mess). But, The Twink introduces me to his friends and they  praise me and buy me drinks with their endless wallets full of  cash..... and all in all I had a wild magical night, and ended up going  home with a hot guy (who might have given me herpes :( I'll have to get  tested, but the chances are apparently pretty slim).

So  yeah.... That was my night last night. I'm 1000 dollars richer, and I  might believe in karma now? Like after I was generous with the homeless  dudes, this dumb-ass drunk-ass ultra-rich Twink ended up being super  generous with me. What goes around comes around my dudes :P",0

Kind lady on the train,bellllyyyy,"This happened a while ago but I've just now seen this subreddit (hi!) and I wanted to share. I was having a particularly off day. I can't even really remember why but I was FRAZZLED and SAD. On my way out of the house I was being particularly antagonistic to my partner and we ended up having a pretty big fight - maybe our first in 4 years? Anyway. It sucked. So I power walked to the train station for about 10 minutes and by the time I got there my angries were sads. I put on my sunglasses to try to be discreet and started quietly crying. Crying buying a ticket, crying putting my ticket in the gates, crying waiting on the platform, crying in the carriage. No sobs just a constant flow of tears and the occasional sniff. Anyway my face was wet but I didn't have any clean tissues, just a scrappy old napkin which I was dabbing at my face between sniffs. A lady was looking at me and it was making me feel really self conscious so I tried to ignore her as much as possible. She tapped my shoulder, and pulled out a beautiful and fresh packet of tissues. I went to take one out and she said ""no no have the whole packet."" and asked if I was ok. I told her I would be and she smiled and patted me then got off at the next stop. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This obviously made me cry MORE and I texted my best friend telling her the story including how shitty my morning was and how I wanted to start carrying around tissues in case I could ever pay it forward and then she shows up to my work with a bunch of flowers and a ten pack of tissues and I have truly never felt more blessed

Thanks for coming, the end. xo",0

Compassionate stranger on a bus,aliengirlie,"Today I had a mental health appointment. During, I was feeling very overwhelmed but managed to keep my feelings at bay and prevent a panic attack. However on the bus ride home I couldn't contain it (I am terrified of going outside, getting on public transport etc) and ended up having a panic attack. My boyfriend was with me to help me through it but I was still uncontrollably crying and unable to maintain my breathing.

As someone was passing me to get off the bus, he gave me his packet of tissues so I could clear my face of the endless stream of tears. As soon as he did, I instantly felt better and less overwhelmed. (I also saw a really cute dog shortly after which helped lift my spirits. We all love a goodboi). 

So not only did he give me the ability to wipe my face, the kindness he treated me with actually helped bring me back down to earth and keep calm. 

Thank you, compassionate stranger. Your small act of kindness truly made my day better. ",0

More than just a bell ringer,christiancool10,"This odd perspective is from me. 

During Christmas i worked as a Bell Ringer for a company that takes donations for the needy by ringing a bell, i’m sure youve heard of the company.

During winter it gets really rainy here, so what i would do on rainy days while ringing was hold an umbrella while ringing;

Whenever someone came out from under the awning of the store i was in front of id hold an umbrella over them while ringing. 

It’s those looks you get of someone who just needed a good thing to happen that truly makes your day. 

At one point i got a few 20s in my kettle(its the official term for the bucket that you put the money into) just for the umbrella, which i told them; i dont take tips, anything for me goes in the kettle.

One lady called the Kroger i was at because i let her borrow my umbrella. Never figured out why she called but she seemed really happy that i was being just kind. 

Thats a reason ill keep going back to thag job if i can, the looks on peoples faces from a simple act to make their day. ",0

Kind Stranger,HappyHobbitses,"Hello everyone!

My first time posting to this sub, and also on mobile so please forgive the format.  Hope you all have a wonderful day!

Some context before we begin: My dad was diagnosed with leukemia almost a year ago, and has to wear a mask in public so he doesn't get sick.  He also wears a hat because the chemo has made his hair fall out.

Today we went to Walmart to get some groceries and as we were walking in a man was walking out.  He was smiling as he approached my dad and I.  He pointed to my dad's mask and asked if he was sick, my dad explained his situation, and upon learning about it the kind man asked if he could say a prayer over my dad.
He said a quick prayer of healing, thanked my dad and he was on his way.

I'm pretty sure he might have been an angel, or at least a very kind stranger.  If you're reading this kind stranger, thank you.",0

Befriends freshman with cancer an helps him out quite abit.,ShavisDork,"Sorry if this is the wrong area for this as wanted to share this story.

So this story takes place during i the second year of high school so was 13 years ago.

I made friends with a kid with cancer in i think it was his left leg, they removed the bone an put in a cadaver bone along with a metal rod in it to help with reinforcing it.  
So he lived pretty close just afew blocks down the street so after school i meet up with him an he ride a bike an i walked, so i just push him on the bike as we talk. As just wanted him to be off the leg as much as possible.  
When winter hit i checked with my grandma when she would pick me up after school that if it was alright if he could bum a ride home as was along the way. 

As winter here can be pretty harsh an alot of snow an with his leg be hard for him to get home.  
His mom would work till later in the day so wouldn't be able to give him ride home.  


So with all the times me an my grandma helped him out by keeping him off the leg as much as possible made it so when the metal rod in his leg did snap it wasnt till thanksgiving of the 2nd year i knew him, while he was with family.  
This was good as it wasnt at some random point of him getting home from school an having hard time getting home or be while he was in middle of the street.

&#x200B;

There lil more to this story.  


So he got cancer again an was in one of his lungs, this was during summer of the 2nd year of knowing him i think, i would come over an keep eye on him an let the nurse in when she knock at the door as she would do her stuff. I just generally kept him company an made sure he was alright as he still had a bumish leg so him falling over would still be a worry some.  


I might have lost contact with him afew years after high school but knowing that my kindness helped to keep him going an safe is enough.  
Tho i do hope he is fine an having a great life.",0
To The Guy Who Asked If I Needed Help,Antichi,"Last summer, I was in a shitty living situation and my job, well it paid but the office was occasionally on fire, don't ask. I had a pretty bad panic attack after getting in a confrontation with my landlord who accused me of not paying the rent and forced me to double pay that month. I needed to get out of that house for a bit so I had packed a bag and started walking down the street. Ended up only making it a few blocks before I had to sit down. 

I was sobbing on the side of the road and literally couldn't breath (panic attacks man they suck). You were the only person who stopped and the only one who asked if I needed help or if you could take me somewhere. I never had the chance to properly thank you so this is it.

Thank you for caring. Thank you for checking in on a stranger. I'm in a much better situation now, but I still think about this a lot. You give me hope that there are still good people out there. I hope you're having a great year because if that act is any indication, you deserve it. ",0

The kind woman who helped me on a rainy day,LifeAndDeath69,"When I was about 8, I had to walk home from school because no one was available to pick me up. It was cold that day, but I didn't anticipate it to rain. I began to walk, and it began to drizzle. Just a few drops, but then the rain got harder and harder, until it was pouring outside. I wondered how fast it got this wet outside. I wasn't even halfway home, when a woman in a truck offers to give me a ride. Not in a weird way, but I was taught stranger danger and planned to decline and start running if she persisted. She asked me if I was absolutely sure, and I said yes. She then pulled out a big flowery umbrella and held it out to me. ""Stay dry, sweetheart,"" she said, and drove off after I took it from her hands. I stood there stunned for a few seconds and then continued the walk with the lady's umbrella over my head and a smile on my face. I still have the umbrella, it has served me well for a long 7 years. I hope she's out there still doing good in the world and going strong. 😊",0

English to Persian?,Samillennia,"So this Persian couple moved into our apartment these 2 very older people and they don't understand English.   


They only know how to say maybe 1-2 things... so one of the laundry machines was out of order and they didn't know how to add money onto their laundry card so I went upstairs and a few google translates and some  notes on my phone later and they were ready to go!  


I taught them how to use the blue laundry card loading machine and showed them which machine was out of order and then to finish it all off I said to them I was sorry I couldn't understand them but I welcome them to Canada and hope they have a great day.   


They were both very happy and relieved... I'm so glad! ",0

Helping out someone who threw out the $250 giftcard and kept the empty one.,greysaphine,"Hi. I work at a grocery store as a cashier. Today was incredibly busy and frankly we didn’t have enough people to properly help everyone who was there. In this wild rush I was put onto Self-Checkout for the day. 

For majority of the day I am checking ID’s for people buying beer, helping people enter in produce items, and reminding people to press the “card” button so their purchase will finish.

During this rush, a woman waved me over looking frazzled.

Her: I swear this gift card had money on it. It’s supposed to. 

Her purchase had not gone through. It was simply a six pack of beer. I run the gift card again just to make sure. It doesn’t work. 

Sometimes the self-checkout machines can just be testy, so I suspended the transaction and brought her over to my station. We tried the gift card again and it is proved to be completely empty. The woman starts to look like she’s going to cry. 

Her: Oh no. It can’t be empty! There were two cards. One was empty and one had $25 on it! I must have thrown away the wrong one!

Me: Do you know where you threw it away? I could help you look.

Her: No, no. This was about a week ago. I doubt it would be there now. 

We clean out our trash cans daily so it most definitely isn’t still there. She continues to talk.

Her: What am I going to tell my dad? He put all of the money on the card. He’s going to be so upset. 

For context, this woman looked to be in her 20’s.

Me, slightly confused as to why she’s stressing so much over $25: You said the gift card had $25 on it, right?

Her: No, no it had $250!

I suddenly realize her panic.

Me: Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry. I honestly don’t know if there’s anything we can do to redeem that.

I’ve only worked there for three weeks now. All of the managers were busy checking people out (yes, that is how short-staffed we were), so I couldn’t ask.  The woman starts digging in her wallet trying to come up with the money to pay for her drinks. I look up at the screen and it’s $12. She looks like she’s about to have a whole breakdown right now and I feel a pang of empathy. 

Suddenly I remember the money in my pocket. My aunt visited my family from out of town today and stopped in my store to see me. While she was there she handed me two twenty’s. Suddenly I’m reaching for one of them. 

Me: You know what... (I pull out the $20) Here. 

Her, obviously flabbergasted: W-What? Dude... No, no it’s fine.

Me: No, please. It’s no problem. 

Her: Are you sure? You literally don’t even know me.

Me: Dude. It’s fine. It’s only $20. I’ve already paid my rent for the month. It’s no sweat off of my brow. 

She starts to protest again, but I’ve made up my mind. I ring up the purchase, put in my $20 and hand her the change.

Her, still stunned: Oh my gosh, that was so incredibly nice of you. 

Me: It’s no problem. I’ve been there. It’s hard. 

Her: Thank you so so much. 

Me; Don’t sweat it! I’m glad I could help you out. 

I then notice someone who has been trying to wave me over for a minute and bid her farewell. 

Later on I got ahold of my boss when it (finally) slowed down and told him what I did, just to make sure it wasn’t against policy to do that. He said it was fine and after I described the situation, he informed me that if we can get ahold of the woman again, we can at least attempt to accommodate for the gift card she lost (since we can track the spendings and confirm that it hadn’t been used and such.) 

I remember her appearance and hope that I see her again so I can share this information with her. After describing her to my boss, he thought she sounded familiar. Hopefully she’s a regular and I can help her get that money back.

(Side note: I know that I said “It’s just $20,” but that’s actually a lot to me. I just knew in the moment that she needed it much more than me. A gut feeling. I went with it.)",0

"Lady tried to throw my BMX away, but the bus driver saves the day.",chapz1234,"(my English is really Rusty so I hope you can understand what I'm saying) I was in the bus with my BMX, then this lady comes screaming at my face about that it's not allowed to carry a BMX inside a bus, but it's clearly allowed because how small it is. Then she proceeded to grab my bike and she almost threw it out, I stopped her and I wanted to scream help but I couldn't. The bus driver saw all of this happening. He asked the lady to calm down but she proceeded to yell at his face. Then the bus driver yelled ""Please get out of the bus or I'll have to call the cops"" then she tried to punch him in the face but he quickly grabbed her and pushed her out of the bus door, she was laying on the snow screaming and then we quickly left. After that, the bus driver asked if I was okay but I couldn't speak so I used sign language, and I was really surprised that he knew sign language too! I told him ""yea I'm okay"" in sign language. The bus driver was really nice and calm. I'm currently at a skate park with some people that now are my friends. The same exact lady that almost threw my BMX came into the skate park where I was and she started to yell at me again after a while and one of my new friends came up to the lady and told her that ""don't yell at her, she is mute"" and the lady replied ""I don't care she is a faggot who should burn in hell about what she did to me yesterday"". The lady threatened to call the cops and my friend just said ""go for it, I'm sure that they will listen to your dumb excuses"". And after a while the cops came and my new friends explained what happened to the cops , I actually recognized who the cop was and then I started to almost cry. The cop was one of my old friends from high school who used to ride BMX with me. It took the cop a while to recognize who I was. The cops gave the lady a ticket or something but the reaction on the lady's face was so perfect, she was in a shock and after that she left screaming.

tl;dr: crazy lady yelled at me on the bus for having a BMX bike, then she got thrown out by the bus driver who saw i was mute. then same lady comes to skatepark and yells at me again, but my friends and cops were there to help",0
A cop knocks on my door to tell me my head lights are on.,TheOnesWithin," So, going to share this because it kinda just made my night. So its a  bit after 1 am (this JUST happened) my boyfriend is asleep, but I am awake  because I don't have work tomorrow.

He tells us we don't have to open the door (Our dogs were barking) but asking if we own the blue hyndai and telling us they I guess I left my lights on.   
The only way I can think he found us is he bothered to stop,  run my plates, get my address, and knock. Thats just like......so cool. I  wouldn't have been mad even if I was asleep. Could have had a dead  battery tomorrow but nope! Officer cool is on the job. ",0
The Man at the Gas Station,melonchollyrain,"I saw a video today of people helping other people, and it reminded me of a story I wanted to share.

Over a decade ago, when I was a broke college student, I ran out of gas a block away from my neighborhood gas station, at 3AM. I walked the block, and asked the gas station attendant there how much a gas can would cost. The cost was 6 dollars, and I only had three and some change, so I asked if he was sure there wasn't a cheaper one. He had been my cashier a couple times, and was always very nice, and may have remembered I never had more than a few dollars to put in my tank, but I didn't know him other than that.

He asked me what was going on, and I explained the situation, but told him I would be just fine, as I only lived a few blocks away, and my parents lived there, and would be able to lend me money. He told me to take a gas can, fill it up and put it in my car, and then drive up to the pump and put twenty dollars in. At first, I said I couldn't let him do that, but he said he wanted to make sure I got home safely. I finally agreed, but told him I wanted to come back the next day and pay him back. He refused to let me, and said it was his last day at that store anyway, and said he wouldn't let me send it to him or anything. He said to just keep shopping there, and that would be payment enough, I'm sure just to be nice. I will never forget how kind he was.

A year or so later, at the very same gas station, when I was still somewhat broke, but certainly doing better, I went to wait in line, and saw another young woman off to the side, crying on the phone. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me her ex must have cleaned out her bank accounts that day, and she had just found out when she stopped there for gas on the way home from work. Her kids were waiting at the babysitter's house, and she didn't even have enough for gas to get to them. I asked her how much she needed to get back to them, and she said $20, hesitantly. I didn't have much, but I had enough to give twenty dollars, and I offered it to her, but she resisted at first. She asked if she could have my phone number or address so she could get it back to me once she got things figured out, so I told her about the man at the gas station, and said instead, if she was ever in a situation where she felt she could pay it forward, to do that instead.

I've always wondered if fate intervened when I ran out of gas, so that that day years later, even though I didn't have much, I would remember the man from the gas station and help her get home to her kids. I will always remember that man, and I hope I will always follow his example when I see someone in need.",0
A stranger paid for my purchase.,jamandee,"I live on a fixed income and it's not a lot but it's enough if I'm careful about my spending   so to make sure I don't accidentally leave myself short I always keep money for necessities in the bank and for non-necessities at home. It prevents me from impulse shopping. 

I double checked my bank account balance just before heading out to get cat food today. It's the last necessity for the month and as expected, I had just enough so I left the house with nothing but my card and a few dollars in change.

My card was declined twice. I asked the cashier to hang onto my stuff for a few minutes so I could step outside and call my bank to sort it out. It turns out that only moments before, my bank withdrew my monthly fees. They were a week early so I wasn't impressed but I still had enough if I used the change I had. 

It was a pain in the ass but not a financial crisis so I headed back in and stood in line again. A woman who was just finishing up at the cash walked to the back of the line and handed me my purchase with a smile and said she'd already taken care of it.

I thought I was going to cry. I've had a really rough week dealing with PTSD flashbacks and this lady touched me hard in the feels. I let her know I got the problem sorted out and could pay for it but she declined so I said ""Well, thank you! That was very sweet. If I can't pay it back, I guess I'll just have to pay it forward."" She made my day. Next time I'm out, I'll make someone else's day.

So close to giving up...,sflfaa,"So a couple days ago, I was planning on working. Busting my ass alllll day. I work for door dash and on Thursday, Valentine’s Day, the app crashed. And I lost all my days pay. Not to mention, I was going to make 8 additional dollars on top of whatever they gave me for a delivery fee. Usually between 5-10$. I was really banking on that money so I could buy another night at the hotel my fiancé and I are living at. We drove around all day Valentine’s Day waiting for the app to start working again. We were on hold with customer support for an hour. We were sitting in dunkin donuts parking lot trying to figure out what the fuck we were going to do for food and where we were sleeping. I was crying and my fiancé was trying to calm me down. I was so close to giving up. The world has been so against us. Out of nowhere, this woman comes up to my window and hands me a box of donuts and said “Jesus loves you. Have a good day”. And I started crying again. The world has been showing us so much darkness. But that woman, that woman showed me that there is still light in the darkness. Thank you, kind woman. ❤️ thankfully, everything worked out, and I don’t have to worry about where we are sleeping or what we are eating for awhile. ",0
"[PART ONE, MY UK TRIP] Showing a little affection and a lot of appreciation",milan92nn,"Unfortunately this is the most documented story that I have but I hope I will be able to paint a decent picture with my words.  


Few years ago I was on a business trip to London and was staying at a small hotel. The hotels services included basic room cleaning at specific times when you should either leave the room or at least let someone from the cleaning staff in. It was the 3rd or 4th day of my stay there when I heard one of the cleaning maids (not sure if that's the appropriate term) say something very muffled and she seemed like she way crying. I stepped out of my room to see if everything was alright and I noticed that she went into the staff room probably to get ready for her shift and to clean the rooms on the floor. I remembered that cross the street, fairly close to the hotel, there was a nice gift shop. Now, I was and still am kind of poor so I couldn't afford much so I bought a nice looking card and a gift coupon and hurried back to my room. I approximately had 40 minutes before she started going around cleaning. Now this lady is dedicated (assuming that for the entirety of my stay she was in charge of cleanliness of my room) because honestly, despite being fairly young I'm loosing hair quickly and at that age I was always in a rush meaning I would always make my bed. She didn't just clean all of my nasty hairs but she always tightened the bed and somehow made the room feel like at home. I made sure to write every single detail I have spotted about her work and tell her how much I appreciate my room being clean and so welcoming. Now, mind you, I've spent approximately 12 USD which will be important soon. I leave for work and after take time walking around London as I knew this is probably one of the few chances I'll ever get to be here.  


I came back to my room in the evening hours and when I open my door I see, on the same table I left my gift for her, something a bit odd looking. I turn on the lights and there I saw a card, a scented candle (it smells amazing!) and a box of chocolates. This is the only thing that I do not really have to explain with words as I took a picture [https://imgur.com/a/7LRJpsF](https://imgur.com/a/7LRJpsF)

COUPLE BLESSED FINANCIALLY & GIVES SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SOMEONE IN NEED,samejourney,"# The following story was shared with us and made us smile...

&#x200B;

I am a lawyer and one of my clients came to my office on Friday with tears in her eyes. She told me that she had been **given a check for several thousand dollars** by a husband and wife she had known for many years.

They knew she had been having a hard time since her husband died 2 years ago and they knew her funds were quite limited. They had recently had some good things happen to them financially and they just wanted to give her this money out of the goodness of their hearts.

Faith in Humanity Restored,Nomadcx,"I have never really believed in humanity, I always thought there must be a catch and there was.

Had a corporate job in the past, dealt with my share of douches and well tried charity work there was always some kind of catch. There were some good deeds I have done, some made me feel real good and some well not so good. Sometimes people I have helped made me feel like they are actually trying to abuse.

Anyways, I stopped believing in random acts of kindness until recently I needed one. Getting help from someone actually felt like a chain, a burden. Looking for ways to pay em back, being in debt not the feelings that I am comfortable with. Yet there is an upside to it it restored my faith in humanity.

There I was lying on a bus stop bench made out of 3 cylinders, getting bitten my mosquitoes, haven’t eaten for a day, ran out of water. my luggage next to me it was around 2 or 3 am.  All of a sudden a car stopped and guys inside asked if I am alright. I said yes, they told me they have seen me at 8 pm at the same bus stop and I told em I am just waiting for my car to pick me up. They didn’t buy it, offered help but well I kept refusing then they wished me good night and left.

I could have really used a sip of water or even a blanket to cover me up but well I was already in debt to another stranger who has helped me so couldn’t afford another one. Maybe an hour passed by and another car stopped. This time a young guy got out and approached me.

I was half sleeping, mumbled some stuff about I am alright but he kept offering help. First he offered to take me someplace to grab a bite, then he offered to check me into a hotel and offered me money but I kept refusing and he kept on insisting.

Imagine me covered in deep shit and someone generously offering a hand and I kept refusing. I even lied to him told him that there s a problem at the bank and I will have money the next day to make him think I am not in a dire situation but he just wouldn’t leave. After maybe 10 or 15 mins, I realized now I am just being rude. I told him how I probably not gonna see him again, not will be able to pay back he kept telling me to not to worry about it. He told me he can’t let me stay here.

He probably didn’t have a lot of money, but there he was offering what he has to a total stranger, even a rude one who kept refusing. I gave up and took up on his offer. We went into his car, we drove to get a bite talked a bit. Then he searched a hotel for me, I told him it is alright but he wouldn’t let me go.

It was late maybe 4 or 5 am so eventually he agreed to drop me off near the center but now he had some money in his hand for hotel. I looked at him and saw how happy he was. That reminded me of times when I helped some people which made me feel real good. I told him that I would never see him again and wouldn’t be able to pay it back he kept telling me not to worry about it. Seeing how happy he was I think he was already paid. 

After we went our separate ways, I actually felt good. I wasn’t be able to express my gratitude but I didn’t need to. I think he was happy just as I was and that was enough for him.

Yet I still hope to see him again one day, not to pay him back but maybe just buy him a beer and talk.

I still feel in debt to two strangers who has helped me. Yes this doesn’t make me comfortable at all but at least now I have faith in humanity. When I see douches now I know they are some people and I know there are good people out there. That’s why not only to them but I have to give back to society as well.


One more thing, when I write about things that happen to me people assume I am asking for help, no I am not. Also don’t have and can’t open paypal so you can’t help even if you wanted to.  So yeah there is no catch, just like the help I received from two people.

Go feed the birds!,MonikaTheBitch,"My heart is screaming. This is probably the sweetest man I have ever met. Scratch that, sweetest person.

&#x200B;

A little bit of background. I live in a pretty low-come area and all of our yards are fenced in, there's also these birds that sometimes come around looking for food, mainly common birds like crow or pigeons but recently we've been getting some others, and I like to feed them (I also wanted to see if my hamster liked birdseed) so every few months I go and buy a small bag of bird feed (in the summer I get a big bag) and that's what I was doing at Candain tire today. Mk, that's your background, onto the sweetest person ever.

&#x200B;

**Sorry if I rambled a bit, it's a bad habit of mine.**

&#x200B;

I'm really socially awkward and have anxiety, so you should take note that I was in this store for a good 20-30 minutes just pretending to look around because I didn't know how to ask a worker for help with finding birdseed, as the type I usually get wasn't there for god knows what reason. But when I finally do get a decent looking kind with the help of a worker (props to him for dealing with a teenager he could barely hear) I got to the check-out and this man (sweetest person ever) gets in line behind me. These lines are really short since not many people are ever in this store at once, so there was no reason to start up a conversation, but he did. He began asking me about feeding the birds so I attempted to make conversation back, by this I mean I mumbled a ""yes"" or laughed awkwardly once or twice. We get to the front and I get my total, pretty cheap, $13. This guy speaks up saying ""I'll pay for hers, put mine on it too."" I was taken aback, I wanted to tell him it was fine and I could pay for it myself, but all I could say was a quiet ""Thank you."" before awkwardly leaving. This all happened a good 15+ minutes ago and I'm still shocked that people like this exist. But I'm also glad that I met one. Now if I ever get the chance to pay for someone's stuff I'll try to, but probably chicken out last minute.",0

Story About my BFF when we where 16.,peterjmonday,"My friend was a waitress. She wanted to be an esl teacher and was pretty good at Spanish for only learning through school. In order to get better, she was saving up for a summer Spanish immersion camp where they teach you Spanish and nobody speaks English the whole summer.

 Anyways she's serving in her section, the breakfast crowd is pretty much gone, and there is a family waiting to be served speaking Spanish to each other nicely, a mom, dad, and two daughters if I remember right. She walks up to one table to give them their bill and then the table next to her starts up loudly saying ""if you're in America you speak English"" and ""stealing jobs from the working class"" all that stuff, obviously wanting the family to hear them and start something. She quite plainly tells the man to either shut up or leave. They where done eating, so they leave.

She goes to the family speaking Spanish as best as she could and says that she is so sorry and asks to take their drink order. They thank her for saying something, because most people wouldn't, much less a small teenage girl to a group of men. 

She gets their drink, takes their order (all in Spanish) and then they ask her to sit since now there is nobody else in her section and the restaurant is pretty much empty, she says yes. They talk for a while she learns their on a road trip to see their other daughter in college, they ask how she learned Spanish and she tells them about classes and the camp and her future plans.  The camp catches their attention and they ask about it and how much it costs, so she tells them and how she has been saving up for this for so long and is proudly only 300 dollars short with a few months to go, so she should make it with some time befor the final payment deadline. 

Anyways they get their food eventually, she starts getting ready for the lunch shift while the family happily talks and gets ready to hit the road again. They get up to leave, when the dad spots her and comes over, and hands her 300 dollars in cash. She starts saying she can't accept it and blah blah, but the man stops her and tells her again how usually nobody does anything about the racism they see. That he isn't some Mexican migrant, but a doctor and he would gladly pay the rest for her to go to the camp that would make her happy and allow her to help others. His family speak fluent English, Spanish is just the language of their people and culture. She is crying at this point and thanks him and his family over and over again until they leave and her boss tells her she doesn't have to split the biggest tip he has ever seen (except for that time a waitress was selling drugs under the table). 

Moral of the story, being kind pays, the end.",0
Some guys helped me get out,peterjmonday,"I have a little two wheel drive and got stuck in our colleges parking lot because a snow drift kinda just ate my car, cause that's life here sometimes. I have spent over an hour in the -20 temp trying to get it out, already had had to pull forward to let people get by me a few times when I was so close to getting out and loose my progress, so when a big deisel pick up pulled up I was ready to just give up and take a chunk of the money I had been saving for surgery to get a tow rather than pull forward again and try to make it back out for another half hour. I was starting to feel sick from the cold, stress, engine fumes, and the thought of all the money I've been trying to save up going in the drain because of fucking snow.

 To my surprise three guys came out and asked if I wanted a push. Took like five seconds and finally I was free. I said a quick thanks out my window and drove away because I just wanted to get out of their way so they could pass, but as soon as I drove away I felt guilty for not thanking them more for saving me 200 dollars, even if it only took them a few seconds and they probably already forgot about it. They could have just gone past like everyone else. So... Thanks random college kids.",0

[Need Advice] Giving positive notes to strangers on New York City Subways,jordansaladi,"Hi r/Randomactsofkindess,

&#x200B;

A few days ago, I came to the realization that a part of me which I had held so dearly during my peak period of self-improvement, has died over the course of the past few months - my love for improving the lives of other people and stepping out of my comfort zone. I started a new job 4 months ago and have been wildly consumed with work and have not thought much about how I can continue growing on a personal level. 

&#x200B;

I've decided I want to try something I've never done before. I want to go from car to car on the subway, handing out words of affirmation to strangers and asking them to pass the message along to another stranger if they find the words to be impactful. I have a whole speech planned out when I enter the car (like homeless people asking for money), but haven't exactly figured what I literally want the notes to say.

&#x200B;

So, I'm here to ask you: What phrase or sentence would you find meaningful if a stranger handed one to you on a piece of paper? What other actions could I take during this experience that would assist in elevating my level of impact?",0

"After all the plane seat stories on ChoosingBeggars, here is a nice experience",OnTime4SocialEvents,"We had to buy a short notice flight.  There was only one seat left in coach so we had to buy our second seat in the seats with “more” leg room.  I got a middle seat in the better section while my spouse sat about 10 rows back.  I had an awesome row, laughing and joking with my row mates (even across the aisle) while waiting for takeoff.

Once in the air, it became apparent that the tv in the aisle seat next to me wasn’t working so the flight attendant moved the guy sitting there to another seat.  As he was gathering his things he suggested I get my spouse so we could sit together.  When my spouse got up to my row, the flight attendant informed us that it would cost $70 if they wanted to sit there, so they started to head back to coach.  Then the most wonderful man across the aisle said loudly “this is crap!  Let them sit together!  Put it on my card!” And gave the flight attendant his credit card for the seat and for a round of drinks for the row.

Responses from fellow redditors,cthael,"I am not sure if this is the right place but the kindness of my fellow redditors warmed my heart.

&#x200B;

Over at /r/AskReddit [/u/krishnajindal](https://www.reddit.com/user/krishnajindal) started a thread called [What luxury do you want in your life this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aewkuw/what_luxury_do_you_want_in_your_life_this_year/).

(Do read it. It's a good read. Humbling, heart warming, and the responses are beautiful.)

&#x200B;

And since my seven year old glasses are still fine and there are more pressing items or better necessities I stated that new glasses would be my luxury item this year.

`In Germany my current ones (about -6 Diopter, extra slim plastic lense and anti-glare options and expensive! frame) cost me in total around €400 or €450 in December 2011. I don't remember anymore.`

`They would still be in very good condition. But since I can't wear contact lenses anymore I started wearing the glasses during climbing and bouldering sessions (and swam with the most blurry vision without any aids like glasses or lenses, hate that!). I figured they're old and I'd get the money to replace them soon. That was two/three years ago.`

`I don't know if I need different values for new glasses. Haven't gone to any optician. So I can't just order something from the web.` 

Anyway. 

&#x200B;

And now I teared up. There were so many messages from people chiming in with tips, coupons and even straight out offers. I am not sure if they'd like to be mentioned or not. To be safe I don't but all who didn't only  pm me can be found over in that thread.

&#x200B;

I am not comfortable with the cash offers, though. And glasses are like I stated a luxury and I have to take care of other things first.

&#x200B;

But from the bottom of my heart: **Thank you all for your offers.**",0

Saved a friend from suicide! YOU CAN DO THE SAME,tcurran712,"A short precursor before I get into the details; Ive known this guy since I was about 7 or 8 years old and we have never been extremely close but we had always just been very chill with each other, mutual friends at most. 

Last night he created a post online explaining that he was going to try to kill himself and that he was not even joking about it. Many people commented on this post out of concern for him saying ""keep your chin up man"" and ""there is so much out there to live for."" While these statements are all true, he continuously insisted in the comments that he was not kidding and sort of hinting at the point that he wished he had never been born in the first place.

Seeing this crushed me inside. I didn't know what to do so I, like everyone else, commented; ""Hey man, lets hang out... right now"" and got no response. At this point I began to get super worried. Maybe he had backed away from the post, or maybe something terrible had happened. I searched through my phone to see if somehow I might still have his number saved, which I did! I texted him but it sent as sms instead of iMessage. I tried calling him but his phone was off and the call went straight to voicemail. 

At this point I grew extremely concerned. I called the police because I decided that if it meant he got taken away somewhere instead of him dying it was completely worth it. The police told me they were already on the case but I gave them a few extra pointers (his disconnected phone number, what kind of car he drove, etc.) and hung up.

Something still didn't feel right. I knew where he lived. And being that he said he would jump in front of a train in his post and that he actually lived relatively near train tracks, I couldn't just leave this in the hands of law enforcement. So I got out of bed, sprinted to my car and drove to the tracks. I looked up and down the rail road tracks and there was no sign of him nor the police. I sped to where he lived and saw his car parked out front. I ran up to the door and pounded on it. After the most grueling minute of my life, he answered. Lost, hopeless and lonely he said ""what's up man."" I ran up to him and gave him the biggest hug of my life. I have never hugged anyone like I hugged him and he hugged me back just as hard. Him and I talked for maybe 5 minutes or so and then the cops showed up. I told them I had everything under control and they were super chill about letting me handle it. 

We sat on his porch for a bit and just talked. He was super lonely during the holidays and didn't feel like he had anyone to live for. For the sake of confidentiality I won't go further into details about what was causing this depression. I told him that I had gone through something similar and that I would always be there for him no matter what. We had some good laughs and I got him to lighten up. We talked about the things that hurt him as well as the things that make life worth living. It was honestly the most rewarding thing not only knowing that I potentially saved his life but also rekindled the friendship that we had. I love him to death and I told him if he ever feels this way again, to stay off of social media and just give me a call instead and I would be right at his doorstep as soon as I could.

I guess what im trying to say here is that if you see something, don't just say something, DO SOMETHING. I was considering leaving it to the police but the police didn't end up showing up until 5 minutes after me and in a suicidal person, those five minutes are potentially life or death. I wanted to share this with you all because id hope that you could learn from it and do what I did. He went back inside after talking for a couple hours and said ""You really are a good friend man. Thank you."" YOU TOO CAN BE THIS GOOD FRIEND TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS IT! Just don't be afraid to put yourself out there. 

&#x200B;

My coworker who everyone loves gets a free car after going through some bad times,Epiknis303,"Ok so this happened a couple days ago and it was pretty great.

In addition to this, she’s just a generally good person and everyone that works with her loves her. All in all she’s gold. Unfortunately, she’s been going through a bit of a rough time recently. She totaled her car (which was a pretty crappy Chevy Cavalier because fast food doesn’t pay well) and had to pay for cabs to work. In addition, her sister had recently been shot (I’m not sure about the details on this, but I’d imagine that would cause a lot of emotional stress worrying about her). We all felt bad for her. But there wasn’t much we could do. Apparently somewhere along the line some customers who came in all the time (and also I think owned a used car dealership) heard about her predicament and decided to do something about it. So these legends came in and waited for her to get off her shift. Then they surprised her by handing her the keys to a car! A shiny blue Chevy Malibu, which was a vast upgrade and a pretty nice car. They also gave her $500 and covered the cost of the tags and everything! She was so overwhelmed and started crying but you could tell she was overjoyed. Everyone congratulated her and it was so awesome. Since then she’s all smiles and she’s in such a better mood all the time. She really deserved it too. So yeah, that’s my story. Hopefully y’all enjoyed! ",0

Fulfilled a Craigslist Request,seeking_theta,"For a long time I've been bothered by the amount of stuff that gets thrown away. If I had to guess I would say that in my city in any given week multiple warehouses of perfectly good objects are being sent to the landfill by those who don't need them and lack the means, ability, time, or caring to rehome them. I didn't realize how bad it was until I started helping my mother-in-law clean out her house of couches, mattresses, etc. They *all* got taken by someone. For awhile I was going to freecycle.org clicking the ""wanted"" section, then cross posting links to other people's free stuff on craigslist that fulfilled the persons request. I assume based on several responses that at least some significant percentage of transactions actually worked out.


This weekend when I saw a post in the ""wanted"" section of my local Craigslist I decided to take matters into my own hands. My wife had gone out to a museum with our 9 month old and her friend + her two kids so I had some free time to myself. 


This request was from a recently divorced single mother working three jobs with a nine year old daughter were sharing an air mattress. She said shes barely making ends meet. This, my friends, is not human dignity. 


So I popped over to the offerup app (my first time using it) and found a queen headboard, bed frame, box spring, and mattress for twenty dollars ($20.00, they were all in great shape). They were in a relatively wealthy family's guest room and they were moving out of the country. I coordinated with both parties via e-mail and in-app messaging, drove 30 miles from my house to the pickup, then another 30 miles directly to the dropoff (essentially I drove a big equilateral triangle).


The feeling and look on a person's face when fulfilling a request like this was totally worth the 90 miles in the car and 1/4 tank of gasoline in my truck. She was sooo thankful. 


I get that volunteering for large organizations may be more efficient in terms of number of people helped per dollar. But it doesn't have that same feeling of really *helping someone* in a significant way. My dream would be to create some kind of informal organization of benevolent pickup drivers who could serve as middle-men (middle-persons if you must) in these sorts of donation transactions.


There are so many people getting rid of stuff that other people need, and it's currently all going to the landfill. I grew up in a wealthy family and for fun I would go recreational fishing with my dad every weekend. What if, instead of that, I had been helping people every weekend as a hobby all those years? I wouldn't even be mad of 1 if 10 people were just abusing this kind of kindness. In the current environment, anyone who posts an open message for help on something like craigslist probably needs it.

I live in one of the poorest regions of the UK, although I am lucky enough not to be ..not rich, but not hand to mouth poor. A request on a local freecycle group caught my eye (below slightly edited to remove name places):

&#x200B;

**WANTED: Help (Please read?) Cooker and/or Fridge Freezer** Hi - really hope you can help ? desperate for a cooker be elec or gas  
and a fridge and or fridge freezer? my younger sis recently diagnosed  
with terminal cancer. has moved back here to be with me and her kids.  
just moved in to new flat .. needs cooker and fridge/freezer. (can  
collect) would love anyone who can help? love to make this xmas special  
for her. thankyou for reading. god bless. x thankyou

&#x200B;

The person had an unusual user name, so I did a quick google out of curiosity more than anything else, and came across their twitter. Turns out the sister had only recently been diagnosed and is in a really hard place. 

&#x200B;

After a short email exchange, I bought this complete stranger a new fridge freezer. I went for food storage rather than a cooker, as I figure it would be better to be able to store food at least, and then they could get a cheap microwave or something. 

I figured it would be helpful to them, but wasn't prepared for the warmth of the recipient's response. I've never had anyone wish their god's blessings on me before I don't think. Made me all warm and fuzzy inside. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: A stranger on the internet needed a fridge, got a fridge.

Just when i was about to give up on humanity...,RancidRoger,"I had a tire that wobbled badly after hitting a curb.  After some thought, i figured it best to go ahead and swap it with the spare.  Upon opening the trunk and lifting the liner, my heart sank into my stomach seeing the round space where it goes empty!  I had just bought the car used from an individual and i looked it over in depth but somehow overlooked this important detail.

As i'm mulling over my limited options, a man parks nearby and goes into a store.  Noticing his car is the same foreign brand as mine (which parts are hard to find for), i  approached him telling of my situation briefly and wondered if he could recommend a place i might could find a wheel the following day.  He mentioned some places but they were not close enough.  ""Online"" was how he got what he needed for his car.  

I thanked him and had turned to walk back to my car when he says ""hold on"" and he has his spare in hand.  ""Take it, its yours."" Suprised, I asked, ""what if you need it?"" He said  ""im close to home, i have two other vehicles and you need it more than i do!""

Helped a senior citizen get their license back,redditvillageidiot,"Hi, meet Patty. She is a wonderful person, but stuck in a tough situation. I met her randomly while having coffee in the motel lobby (where she is currently living), and we got to talking and it turns out she hasn't had her driving license for almost 2 years. She was in an auto accident, not totally her fault, but in my opinion they took her license because she was a senior.

She just had no one to take her out to practice driving, and a car to take the test in. So... I said lets get you that drivers license. I took her out for practice driving 4 separate times, and really probably drives better than me. She passed with flying colors :)

The next steps are finding low income housing for seniors (advocap?) and not sure what else. Really none of that matters right now, one step at a time.  Also, I know a scammers are out there, but she is not, never asked me for a dime and has a good heart. I took her out to Culvers for a celebratory dinner, and if I can help her down the road I will.

If anyone has any good advice on how to help seniors get back on their feet please PM or post something.

V/R,

Me

Thank you big bag lady!,Momof3xox,"Yesterday I was leaving food pantry on foot, with my two sons. The pantry has a van and they’ll usually agree to meet us around the block at my house (no kids allowed on van) but I guess the van was in an accident so- we had to walk and try to carry 8 big bags. Bottom of our stroller SUCKS. In the middle of a busy street, at a red light, my bags bust open and rip ! Now I’m a frantic mess light turns green and I’m trying to get our stuff- and to the other side safely ! 

When out of no where, a women, who came from oppisite direction than food pantry (so I know it wasn’t someone from there) runs up to me with the BIGGEST reusable grocery bag I’ve ever seen, like seriously 3feet long, with a shoulder strap. 

I was already having a seriously tough morning, breakdowns, and verge of panic attack. 

So thank you big bag lady, you saved the day! ",0

Went for free pet vaccines and then found a dog,missamanduh2,"I wasn't able to afford the annual vaccines for my dog so I took advantage of an event that our local Humane Society has where they give the first 1000 people free vaccines. They started at 9:00 a.m. and I didn't have a car so I had to arrange for a ride that wasn't always reliable and then the morning of the event the temperature in Tampa dropped to 56° so it seemed like the odds were against me on getting to this event I really wanted and needed to get to. Thankfully I made it and they still hadn't reached 1,000 yet so we were able to get the shots as well as some freebies like treats and doggie bags and leashes. On our way home there was a dog running back and forth in traffic and I was totally unaware of it because I was totally spoiling my own furbaby for being a good girl the whole morning. My friend who was driving stomped on the brake and I saw the dog who crossed our car and was running into the next lane where the driver also tried to avoid hitting him and went around him. I jumped out of the car and thank God the dog had a fabric studded collar on and I was able to hold it while I asked my friend to pass me the leash we had coincidentally I just gotten for free at the event. I didn't want to pull on the collar of the dog because it wasn't really interested in moving from where it was standing in the street. I attached the leash and walked to the closest Street which wasn't in the best part of Tampa. Every house had bars on the windows and doors and the street was empty except for two little black boys who were riding their bikes. I knocked on the first house and the home owner refused to open the door and told me nobody on that street had dogs except for a lady three houses down and all her dogs were small and she didn't own the dog I had leashed. It sounded strange that she was so positive that nobody had a dog on that street but when I approached the little boys on their bikes they said the same thing and then asked if they could get the dog and if she bit. I told them I wasn't sure and I didn't want to find out and they said they would ask their sister for help who came outside and said she didn't know where the dog belonged and she didn't own the house she was at and she couldn't help me. The entire time my friend was pulled off to the side of the road with my dog who was getting very impatient and vocal and I told him I wanted to check the street on the opposite side of the road because it might have come from there and he was leaning more towards just leaving the dog in the neighborhood since it was at least off the highway where there was tons of traffic. I couldn't leave the poor thing like that so I was headed towards the other side of the road when I spotted a man coming my way and asked if he knew where the dog possibly came from and he said he didn't know bit he would take her. We were still a good half hour away from home so I was pretty thankful that he took her because at least she was off the street where she was almost hit a few times and someone who lived around there could find her owners or do something with her. I came back to the car and told my friend that a man took her and the two little kids on the bikes had made their way to our car by then to play with my pug while I was trying to help the other dog and when I said who I gave the dog to they immediately knew who I was talking about and said ""You mean that baser? You gave the dog to the baser?"". They couldn't have been older than 6 or 7 but it kind of caught me off guard that they said that because I wasn't expecting that and one of the kids shook his head disapprovingly but the important thing was the dog was off the road and not running through cars. I felt pretty proud that I was able to get the dog off the road even though I couldn't find her owners. It wasn't until I got back in the car and we started driving again that my friend told me that the car next to us had actually hit it when it tried to stop. Poor thing, I hope the baser found the owners or at least made sure the dog went somewhere safe or took it to someone who could care for it. ",0

Surprise care packages,bogbluth,"This year we had our first child, and since we don't have any family around to help, it's been really tough. But I've been overwhelmed by the kindness shown towards us by friends in all sorts of thoughtful ways. It really reminded me of how good people are. So I wanted to pay it forward. 

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, I've been putting together a surprise care package each week for a different person in my life if I identified that the could do with some cheering up. The first one went to a close family member who's been kind of down lately and going through a rough patch. The next went to another new mom who's been experiencing the same as me. Another package went to a lady (she's more my parents' friend, I only know her a bit) who is taking care of her daughter's severe health issues and there's not much she can do about it so she's been ultra worried and stressed. None of these people ever asked for anything but at some point they vented to me. I'm not rich so the packages included some home-made treats and various other small things relating specifically to the issues they're facing (which would help relieve sadness, stress, worry etc.), and a handwritten note of encouragement.

&#x200B;

The first two packages have been received and the recipients were surprised and super happy! :) Waiting for the third one to be picked up at the post office. This is so much fun :D ",0

RAK paid forward,shortcakie,"Theres a man in his 20s in my city who desperately needed a winter coat.  He's a larger size but my bf and I thought we could help him.  My bf has recently lost a lot of weight and is down from a size 7x to a size 4x. So yesterday I took a almost new winter coat (it was worn once last year) to the soup kitchen and searched for this guy. 

When I located him I said,  if it fits,  it's yours. 

He tried it on and it fit perfect! It was cold and rainy here yesterday so I'm grateful it fit him and it'll get good use.

I wish my bf had boots that would fit this kid because he could really use something warm on his feet  but the kid wears a size bigger than my bf. ",0
I returned a dog to his owners,sickbutterygnar,"I was outside smoking a cancer stick and it's fairly cold right now and this dog randomly ran up to me and was all about the pets and attention. Had a collar but no tags. I have two cats that don't care for dogs so I didn't want to try and coax him inside so I asked my SO to get the leash we have for walking our cats (they love being walked outside in the summer) and walked around asking my neighbors if they had a lost dog.

Ended up being my new neighbors that just moved in and haven't had their fence put in yet.

RAK paid forward.,SirGuido,"On Saturday my wife and her family were eating breakfast prior to going to an event where they were going to make kits for cancer patients. Just things to help them out and cheer them up. Scarves for women, hats for men, hand sanitizer, hard candy(the chemo can make your mouth taste bad), gum, little bags of chips, that sort if thing. She happened to mention it to their waitress when they ordered but thought nothing of it. 

When they went to pay the waitress told them that their breakfast had been already paid for by another diner who wanted to be anonymous. A real RAK kind of moment. But the story doesnt stop there! On the way to the event they decided to stop for coffee. My wife kept thinking about the approx $15 she'd just saved and how she felt guilty. So while ordering she asked for a gift card. She turned around and handed the gift card to the folks behind her. When they acted strange about it she just said ""just do something nice for someone else.""


Oh ho! But the story doesnt end there! At the event a woman who had signed up to bring hand sanitizer hadn't shown up. So again my wife remembered her morning and volunteered to go buy some. She was in line when a man behind her made a comment ""expecting a lot of germs or just really dirty hands"" and laughed. My wife realized how it looked and explained to him why she was there. He insisted on paying for the hand sanitizer and then gave her his business card. Hes an executive for a local company that makes trial sized items and wants to talk to the organizer so his company can donate!

How crazy is that day! Sometimes the world aint so bad.",0

We sat down and waited for our food but it seemed to be taking a while but whatever it is what it is. But then our food does come and something seems a bit peculiar. This absolute legend sent with this other waiter a milkshake on the house with all sorts of wonderful flavors in it. And let me tell you this was the best goddamn milkshake I've ever had in my life. My day had already been kinda crap because I was stressing about my wisdom teeth all day but this dude made my day with this milkshake.

A full day of pay-it-forward at work.,abbyabsinthe,"For a little context, my store has a rewards program that we're phasing out for a new one, and our customers have to print them off and use them before the end of the year. You can get various prizes such as coffee, soda, candy bars, pizza, jerky, cookies, etc... Some customers have *hundreds* of rewards, and some have only a few, but today, both types were leaving their coupons for other people to use to get a free coffee or soda (someone left one for a free candy bar, admittedly I grabbed that one), so we've been able to surprise people with free drinks all day.

I also had two gentlemen in line today (before people started leaving the coupons), both regulars; one's an old farmer in beat up overalls and the other a young, super polite office professional. I had the old farmer first, and he got his daily paper, milk and donut; he especially needed it today because, as he said, ""the vampires at the doctor's office got me today"". As he was pulling out his money, the young dude behind him, said ""I got this"". He noticed the old Army jacket the farmer was wearing, and wanted to thank him for his service.

At the end of my shift, I had a gentleman whose card declined when he was getting gas, milk, and some pizza. He only had enough cash on him to cover his gas, and went to put the rest back. I had a coupon for a free pizza, and inspired by my earlier guests, used it for him to at least get his pizza.

My stories from today ain't much, but the unexpected kindness and generosity of many of my guests put a positive spin on my day, and hopefully on the days of several others.",0

"A Caring Cross, A Helping Hand and A Life Saved",puppies_and_unicorns,"My cat got out Friday and hasn't come back. He is an indoor only cat and I live in the desert. We have had an unusual amount of rain too, which makes it harder for him to find his way back. 

I was out looking for him Sunday and heard a pack of coyotes during the day which is unusual. I ran in the direction of the noise and got terribly turned around. The neighborhood is a bit odd here and streets dead end into yards. I couldn't find my way out of the yard but saw the main road from my spot and started making my way that way. 

Being on private property is generally a no no but I couldn't avoid it. There was a wood fence with just two poles and a very mean dog inside it. It started to run after me. I'm pretty experienced with dogs and not many scare me. Luckily the dog's owner was in the yard and kept calling for him but he kept running and this fence wasn't going to contain him.

I just stayed calmly in place and kind of played ring around the rosy with him when he jumped the fence. He eventually went back inside while his owner yelled at me. 

How is this RAOK related? Once she calmed down and I explained my dilemma she truly did a 180. She was concerned I would get attacked and then more concerned I was lost in the desert!

She invited me to sit on the patio and relax and have some water and chat while I regained my bearings. She ended up giving me two wooden crosses she made out of rare dried cactus that is over 100 years old (I forgot the kind). We talked about our pets, how mine got out and what I was doing to find him. She gave me a ride home and her card so I could stay in touch. 

While this has been a terrible experience, I have been touched by the people I have met along the way. Even the grocery store managers stop me to ask for updates and I dont even expect them to remember me. 

I would love for Coop to come home but even if another family decided to take him in, there are some amazing people in this community that would probably spoil him more than I ever could. I just hope somehow I find out he is ok. I am grateful for the bond I am forming with the community though.",0

Getting in cars with strangers,Twizzinkle,"This happened a few years ago. My boyfriend and I had moved back to my hometown. We had just moved out of my dads house and into our own apartment. We both were working minimum wage jobs and we were really poor. On this particular day, we walked to the grocery store. It wasn’t too far, maybe a mile or so down the road.  As we were shopping, we were trying our best to get the most for our money, as our grocery budget was only $75 for two weeks worth of food for the two of us.  Because the food needed to last us two weeks, our grocery cart had a lot of canned food items. We checked out and headed home. The first block was alright, as was the second. By the time we got to the third block my arms were so tried and sore. It seemed like our apartment was just getting further and further away. My boyfriend suggested that we just take the bus back home. While it sounded like a good idea, we didn’t have the $3.00 needed to get on the bus. So we kept walking. We made it to the fourth block and I was done. I couldn’t carry these groceries any further. That’s when it happened. The lady who was behind us in the check out line pulled into the parking lot. She got out of her car and asked if we needed a ride. She had said that she saw us walking across the grocery store parking lot as she was putting her groceries in the car and had hoped we had lived close by because we had some really heavy groceries. She said when she saw us still walking a few blocks later that she had to help. She offered to take us and our heavy ass bags of groceries to our apartment. I could hear my mom’s voice in the back of my head telling me not to get into a car with a stranger, but the lady really seemed kind and I was really tired. We took her up on her offer and she drove us the few more blocks to our apartment. Once we arrived she reached into her purse and pulled out a gift card for the grocery store. She said there wasn’t much money on it, but she thought we could really use it.  While it may not really seem like much to most, it meant so much to me. Not only did she help us get back home, but she also gave us a gift card with almost $200 on it. We saved it for the weeks when money was too tight for groceries. I don’t remember her name, but I will never forget her kindness.",0

"Bird and Lime are cool but inaccessible to some, so I started a project to give kids in Detroit free scooters.",Insomnya3AM,"Hey reddit:

I'm Andy, a Detroit native. I recently signed up as a charger for Bird scooters. You might know that when a scooter is super lost they increase the bounty paid out to charge that scooter up to $20. I went into the neighborhoods in Detroit to try and find some of these ""high bounty"" scooters and what I found kinda blew my mind.

I came into a big housing complex and found about 10 kids pushing around 4 dead Lime and Bird scooters. I got to talking to the kids and they were super friendly but didn't have much of an idea why someone dropped off these scooters in their neighborhood. Scooters that light up totally look like a toy, and so what is an eight year old to do?

The trouble is that kids and lots of adults in Detroit don't have the required drivers licenses, bank accounts or money on hand to take part in this ""big cool future."" It must really suck to be a Detroit kid in the summertime and see these cool looking scooters with the lights sitting out on the street corner but you're technically not allowed to touch them unless you have the means.

So I started Play Free Bird ([www.playfreebird.com](https://www.playfreebird.com)) where people can send us electric and manual scooters from Amazon and we'll assemble, charge and distribute them to Detroit kids who need them. It's a small project designed to make things better. If anyone is going to drop off scooters in an urban environment like Detroit they should be accessible to everyone.

I'm open to your feedback if you have any on our project - and we'd love the support if you have the time.

PS: We got a front page story in The Detroit Free Press about our project. You can read that here: [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm\_medium=twitter&utm\_source=dlvr.it](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it)

My birthday is usually forgotten,liecurious,"Hi folks. I don't know where to share this, but I figured here was as good a spot as any.

This is essentially a collection of random acts of kindness I received today that made me feel loved.

TL/DR at the bottom

As the title says, my birthday (September 6th) typically gets forgotten. It's really no ones fault. I even forget some years. It's just a super busy time of year for my family (my mother is the principal of a high school and she had to deal with 3 kids who all liked extracurriculars) and for my friends (I'm in university and September is freaking busy). Again, I'm not saddened by this. Everyone eventually realizes and I celebrate whenever that was.

So, today was my 22nd birthday and I remembered this time around. I was looking forward to simply singing taylor swift ridiculously loud and maybe getting a phone call from home.

However, I was rushed out of bed by my coworker (I work in the dorms while I attend school) saying that there was an emergency just before midnight. I run up in my pjs and see the whole staff there with a giant card and food serenading me with my favourite song. Then, while we are celebrating, a student living in the dorms walks past and asks who's birthday it is. They point me out and he decides to give me $50 despite my protestations because someone else was kind to him on his birthday. 

This is all within 30 minutes of my birthday.

I eventually get to bed and I see that a lot of my friends have sent happy birthday messages, again warming my heart. I wake up to people anonymously posting on an app at my school that it's my birthday and that they really appreciate my presence on campus. I go to class and my class all shouts happy birthday at me when I walk in. Most people I pass wish me a happy birthday. My grandmother calls to wish me a happy birthday. My mother calls. My sister calls. My boss calls. 

At this point, I'm so overwhelmed by the fact that so many people cared enough to remember my birthday that I think I might cry, but it doesn't end.

My brother arrives with 3 of my close friends and takes me out to dinner at a place I used to work at. I get there and the staff all come and wish me a happy birthday and then grab me a free shot. THEN, they come out with our most expensive dessert with extra everything and give it to me for free AGAIN.

I know it doesn't seem like much, but it was truly the best birthday I've ever had. 

TL/DR: I thought that everyone would forget my birthday but so many people did kind things for me instead.",0
Guardian Angel from London,LeniaLilac,"Hello guys! 
Let me tell you the story of How I Lost My Wallet.
My friends and I went on a spontaneous 24-hour party trip to Mallorca a month ago. Not only did we miss our flight and only got a later one because of the very nice lady at the Ryan Air counter, but I also lost my wallet somewhere between buying the first beer at the airport and trying to buy the first beer in Palma. I suspected someone stole it out of my bag when I walked down the street, but kind of hoped I left it in the taxi and the driver would get back to the hotel where he dropped us off or bring it to the Lost and Found. Well, no. When we had to get back to the airport I still had no wallet, no money, no ID, nothing. I got back home safely (thanks to the lovely ladies at the airport - again) and had no hopes AT ALL to get my stuff back.
Well. This morning my old boss from uni called me and left me a voice message. Someone found my wallet and sent it to my university and I could come and pick it up. 
Some lovely lady from London found it in the taxi, took it back home and mailed it back to Germany. ALL documents still inside and ALL THE MONEY still in there. Can you believe it?! I’m literally still crying with joy!
Unfortunately my guardian angel from London did not include her address, but I’d love to send her a proper thank you.

Random stranger insisted on giving 2 bucks.,riquillers,"So this is pretty small. When I was like 10, while waiting for the bus, a fancy car pulled over. An old man came out of it and insisted on giving me the equivalent of 2 dollars, for no apparent reason. I didn't really need the money, my family was doing fine(as a kid I'd always bring snacks from home rather than lunch money though, so having cash was a rare, beautiful thing) but I took it anyway. That day I shared it with my best friend at the time of...

Probably saved a pregnant woman's job by speaking up,Cranksta,"I (22 female) worked for a seasonal company over this last tax season and it was pretty basic tech support stuff, but can involve very long calls. Tax law is very hard to navigate and doing that on top of software support means sometimes you're on that call for four hours.

I had worked my way up pretty quickly and was an online supervisor for the last few months of the program and very tight with most of the floor managers as well as the OP manager. I was known as the person who can get something done quickly while remaining within policy limits and pretty much had free run of the place since I knew the system inside and out. I was also trusted to help train the newbies and do floor support when needed.

So one night I was working overtime and was doing my usual floor work while the floor managers were busy with paperwork and was helping a woman who was probably working well into her third trimester. She'd been on the call for two hours and was very uncomfortable as she needed to use the bathroom (baby sitting on your bladder is utter torture) but the call was going to last another hour at the very least.

She'd hit her limit so she told the gentleman she'd be back and went on her way. The client seemed more than willing to wait so I didn't say anything and just let her go.

She was back within six minutes and finished the call like a champ. I went to help other agents.

I was walking by her team leads desk and he and another team lead were arguing about what to do about her because she left the floor while on a call. The female team lead was on her side and the male team lead was not.

This woman was sitting not two rows from them and they were arguing about whether or not she needed to be written up. They asked me for advice.

I'm 100% certain that the male team lead expected me to be on his side since I was a stickler for policy, but for me my staff's comfort matters far more than some arbitrary composure policy. She was back quickly and did nothing wrong in my book. There's always room for compromise.

So I looked him dead in the eyes and told him, ""This isn't a matter of policy. It's a matter of dignity and I think that's something we can bend on.""

He looked shocked, like he hadn't thought of it that way. Like he'd never taken into consideration that we were asking a woman who's about ready to pop to stay on the floor for hours at a time and that it doesn't really mesh well with the needs of a pregnancy.

The female team lead was very much ""See! Thank you!"" but the male team lead was very quiet and confused.

With the conversation over I walked over to the woman who'd heard all of us talking and gave her a smile and she smiled very brightly back and seemed very grateful. I don't think she's had someone stick up for her at work before and probably expected to be thrown under the bus.

Seeing her mouth ""Thank you"" was easily one of the most rewarding moments in my life. It's something I've thought about ever since, even though I no longer work for the company.

Someone's gotta stick up for the little guy and I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it and wasn't too coward to speak my mind.

I had a few other incidents with the company that got me in trouble for covering for the frontline agents, but I don't regret a single one of them. I think I earned a fair amount of good karma for it and hope someone stands up for me when I need it.",0

Awestruck Encounter,ralphieishere,"It has been a long year. Business has been bad, cryptos keep dropping and life literally sucks.

A few nights in a room, a couple sleeping in the truck.

It's been tough. 

Really, it wouldn't be so bad  if it was just me. I love camping  and I could live a primitive lifestyle Survivorman only  wishes he had the cajones to pull off (sorry Les; love ya).

But it's not just me.

My best friend ""lives"" with  me; along with her dog and cat. She's disabled and not really able to care for her own basic needs in a financial way the past couple of years. Which is, again, even more trying as a freelancer to fill in those gaps for her. Most times I pull it off like a champ. Other times (more and more here lately) it seems that nothing I do matters.

Well, last week we hit one of those ""oh shit we have to camp in the truck"" days when I just couldn't scrape up money to let us stay over. I was expecting a couple of payments. But, if you've ever freelanced you understand that when you need it is when it never shows up; at least on time.

Anyway, Florida is hot as fk. And, about midafternoon I was sweating like a pig and really just pissed off at the world seeing her suffer like she was. In fact, she had been crying for over an hour when I just had to get out and take a walk.

It was when I got back that I saw the end of what was an amazing encounter.

Apparently my friend was sitting there crying her eyes out and this lady pulled up out of the blue. She asked my friend what was wrong and the story came pouring out, along with a few more gallons of extreme despair filled tears. 

Anyway, after the story was over the lady said, ""God told me you needed my help; so please take this."", as she handed my friend  $100. 

My friend started weeping all over again and told the lady she was going to use that to pay for the room for the night

The lady said ""No, you keep that for yourself. I'll pay for the room. "" And the two of them went into the motel whereupon the lady pulled out a credit card and paid for a roomfor the night. 

As the two of them exited the office that's when I walked back up to the truck. Still no answers and no hope. Not seeing my friend in the truck I looked around confused and saw the two of them in front of the motel office in a tearful embrace.

The lady never even looked my way when she walked back to her car parked next to my friend's truck.

But when my friend opened the door of the truck and sat down she began crying loudly for a few minutes before telling me this story.

Although life doesn't work out like that very often, sometimes the universe takes pity on us; and, not every person is so self centered that they overlook the suffering of others.

Whatever you're doing today whatever your own situation; I hope that you all get such a gift of mercy from the universe today.

Thanks  for listening.",0

Saying the right words at the right time,blank_spaces_,"I work at an Italian takeout restaurant and today this lady came in and I just happened to help her instead of my co-worker. She was French, had an accent, and had a hard time expressing some words in English (which she apologized for but I told her not to worry, that I understood her, and that she was doing great). She came in looking for a salad to buy because she was having people over and the only thing she was missing was another side dish. She also told me that she would be leaving to Paris tomorrow. I proceeded to help her out but none of the salads we had today were complementary to what she was serving for dinner. I then helped her brainstorm some ideas as to what she should serve. I don’t usually spend so much time with a customer but somehow I was drawn to helping this woman out. I even grabbed my phone from my purse and helped her search up recipes. This went on for a while, maybe 25 minutes, and we had other customers coming in and my co-worker tended to most of them while I helped this lady out. When she finally decided on a recipe I told her of all the nearest grocery stores and shops where she could find the ingredients. She also decided to buy some pasta and rose sauce from our store. After paying, she grabbed my hand, thanked me for taking so much time with her and helping her out and she whispered to me, ""I hope and wish you a happy life."" I had no idea how those simple words from a stranger could have had such an impact on me. I've been thinking a lot about my life and future recently and in the process it has made me a bit somber and bitter, for a lack of better words. This woman had just made my day and perhaps even my week, month, or even year. It gave me a reassurance that my life could be a good one and one filled with happiness . I squeezed her hand as a kind gesture and before she left I asked for her name. So Doris, wherever you are, I am sincerely thankful for what you said to me. I hope to see you again someday and may you have a life filled with happiness as well!",0

Real life Blind-Side,Book_Bear,"My mom tells this story about a friend of hers who was the athletic directer at a really nice private school in the mid-west.

They had 48 hours before they were required by law to turn him in to the authorities, but then he would have to live in this compound with other homeless kids and take classes there and never really get to leave, and he was a straight A student and the star of the basketball team at a really elite private school, so that wasn't fair to him. Finally someone asked the kid what he wanted, and he said, ""I think I could concentrate more on my classwork if I knew where I was going to sleep at night."" and my mom's friend was like screw it I'm taking this kid. The boy's mother was still alive, but she was a drug addict and couldn't take care of her children.

My sincere thank you to 3 strangers on my travel!,Johnny_Fratkins,"Just want to share my travel story from about a month ago and how 3 random acts of kindness from 3 strangers turned my disastrous situation around.

I was travelling from my home in the United States to a foreign country. I drove towards an airport that was a few hours away from me. I needed to get gas along the way (I drive a gas hog that gives me poor miles per gallon); the fact that I needed to get gas (or petrol, for you Europeans) is going to loom large later on in the story.

After I got gas, it was the last time I used my wallet. Before I got to the airport, I made a stop at a coffee shop where I paid with my phone. There were some suspicious characters/homeless type in the store and one was behind me. I was wearing special work pants that had extra pockets on the outside of my thigh, like cargo pants. My wallet was in the pocket on my right thigh and my passport and foreign currency was in the pocket on my left thigh. It looks like my wallet was stolen right then because I didn’t have to use my wallet until I got to my destination and yes, things don’t fall out of my work pants. I’ve been wearing these pants for years now and I know the pants really well.

After my 5-hr flight, I landed at my destination. I arrived at my hotel and the front desk lady asked to see a credit card to cover for incidentals. That was when I realized I no longer had my wallet. As I was panicking over my lost wallet which contained all my credit cards, debit card, and U.S. driver’s license, the front desk lady was very understanding and accommodating.

She gave me free WiFi access (that hotel charged for WiFi) and let me get checked into the room to make phone calls and rest up a little bit with a deposit of a small amount of my limited amount of cash in that country’s currency. That was kind act #1. I tipped her the equivalent of $5 American dollars before I checked out the hotel.

As I called my credit card companies and banks, yes, there had been some fraudulent activities on my credit cards in the town of that coffee shop I was last at in the United States.

I then called the airline to explain my situation – I had no credit cards and basically no money and I needed to get back home to the United States ASAP. The agent was very understanding and accommodating yet again. As I arrived in the foreign country on a Friday late in the afternoon, he was able to get me on the earliest flight back the next morning at 6am (Saturday morning). He charged me no changing fees. Kind act #2

So in a foreign city, thankfully I still had some cash to get food and rest up for the night before flying back to the States first thing next morning. However, I had one more problem: I needed parking money to get my car out from the airport garage and gas money to drive home once I’m back in the US. With my limited cash in the foreign currency, even after exchanging it back to US dollars, that was not enough. Uber was not an option not just because of the distance between my home and the US airport I flew out of, but also all my credit cards were now deactivated.

With no debit cards or credit cards, I needed a kind soul to be willing to give me some cash and I can then Venmo or wire him/her money with my phone. The guy who sat next to me on the plane turned out to be my savior. As we chatted on the plane, I told him about what had happened to me.

Once we got our luggage at the airport, I asked him for the favor. With no hesitation, he gave me $40; when combined with the money I exchanged at the airport, that was enough to get my car out of the parking garage and the gas money to get me home. As I insisted on Venmo’ing the man, he insisted back saying that it’s okay, things like this happen when one is travelling, and just “pay it forward.”

As we hugged and then shook hands, the amount of thankfulness and gratefulness was indescribable. As a fairly well-to-do man, I had never felt so helpless in my life. Yet, I encountered 3 kind people who helped me to get home safely.

Maybe it’s the karma I’ve built over the past 10+ years by helping and volunteering for the underserved. I am still and forever will be thankful for these individuals (Jess, Todd, and Dan). I am also thankful that I still had my cell phone and my passport and cash in the foreign currency. I will continue to pay it forward!",0
Summer camp for neglected kids,Andr7271,"This is just me pouring my heart out, after a tough week with some amazing kids!

I just got home from being a summer camp leader for children, who comes from terrible homes. They have experienced domestic violence, sexually abuse, failed caring, special needs, and parents who just don't care at all. 

I spent my entire week with 20 other amazing volunteers, trying to create the best possible camp for these kids, who don't experience care and love daily. 

One kid showed up at camp, with only 2 sets of clothes and a blanket for a whole week. One off the days I played ball with him, and roughly 20 minutes into the game, he said ""thank you for your attention"" he almost made me tear up. 

Another episode was the last day off camp were my big brother (who also was volunteer) 
Just sat down with a really troubled and demanding child. He just stared into his eyes and said ""I'm proud of you, you are amazing and I care for you."" This kid have been sexually abused, currently lives at a orphanage and thinks he is a zero. Now he completed a whole week of great activities, got several friends, and the feeling of being loved

Sorry if the English I bad or it doesn't fit this sub, I just needed to get it off my chest! 
Have a nice day! And thanks for tuning in!

The other day I bought a meal for a foreign lady who was embarrassed to ask for a meal.,ehight225,"Me and my gf were walking into Panda Express and noticed an older stout lady who was standing outside the entrance waiting to catch our attention. She had a boy with her who I am assuming was her son. 
I could tell she was embarrassed since it was dinner rush and many people were around but in her broken English she asked if I could buy her a meal to feed her children. 
It broke my heart that she has to ask for help to feed her kid so I brought them inside and bought them a plate with a drink. She thanked me and took the meal out after I paid. 
After I ate with my gf, I saw her again out in the parking lot in a crappy old minivan. The door was open and she was in there feeding at least three or four children with the meal I bought them. 
This sight broke my heart. I’m just glad I could at least buy them a meal. ",0
Small act of kindness from a friend,,"So today was my first time donating blood, for a blood drive a friend of mine’s girlfriend was running. The actual donation itself went smoothly, blood and pain don’t really faze me too much, it was fascinating to watch. However, afterwards, I made the mistake of standing up way too fast after the draw finished, and passed out on the waiting area. I fell off of a chair, and smacked my nose and head into the floor, hard, before rolling under a table.

I woke up in a random volunteer’s arms, surrounded by strangers, and my friend and his girlfriend. I don’t like being touched by strangers, and my first question was “why are you holding me under a table?” followed by me squirming out of her arms and sitting on the floor terrified and confused. 

My friend and I have known each other since we were 10 (we’re 17 now) and he’s one of those guys who doesn’t like to express emotion, and I’m one of those guys who’s afraid of showing their feelings or that they’re hurt because they worry they’ll be teased for it, but while I was on the floor I was disoriented and scared and hurt, and I pretty much begged him ""please don't leave me"" when he left to find my dad. Instead of just reassuring me he’s be back or having someone come sit with me, he sent his girlfriend to go find my dad, and then came and sat on the floor and held me until my dad got there, and checked on me when I left to go to the hospital to get checked for a concussion. 

It’s a really little act, but for someone like me, who experiences anxiety around social situations and whether or not friends truely care or are just putting on a front, having someone like him come and hold me while I was scared and hurt, and be nothing but comforting meant the world to me.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the gold! Your nice comment made my day

EDIT 2: Turns out I did get a concussion, which is a bit of a pain in this day and age",0
Comforting someone in a park,Squishy_Pixelz,"This was eating through my mind for a while, so I thought I’d share.

So a few days ago, I had to go back into school during summer holidays to do some paperwork for a teacher. Since I wasn’t needed the whole day, I went to the local petrol station near school to get some breakfast and snacks.

On the way back to school while taking the long way through a park, I see this dude standing by the lake. His face looked really blank, but sad I think. I have autism, so I normally can’t tell when it comes to facial expressions or anything social. But something in my gut was telling me to talk to this dude, so i built up the courage and I asked if he was okay.

Suddenly he sits on the ground and tells me his story. I sit with him. I won’t get into much detail since it seemed personal, but he basically told me about the people who left his life in various ways and some of his recent failures. Like the socially awkward mess I am, I told him that it’s okay and offered him a sausage from the petrol station I got for breakfast. He smiled, thanked me and accepted, then just left. Glad I made someone smile that day!",0
Bad accident,darkhelmet46,"Story time. 

This past Saturday, my wife and I were returning back to Massachusetts from Pittsburgh with our two kids. We were driving eastbound on 376 near Monroeville at about 11:30PM when suddenly we saw brake lights and stopped cars in both lanes of the highway. The accident must have happened just minutes or even seconds before we arrived. We were about 4-5 cars back and saw a pickup truck up against the Jersey barrier dividing the East/West sides of the highway. Suddenly my wife said ""Oh my God, there's someone on the road.""  I looked closer and saw a huddled mass just laying there.  People were starting to get out of their cars. One person was on a cell phone walking around the person on the road. They were all young girls, late teens or ealy 20's, probably on their way to a night out. A couple of them started going up to cars, motioning them to roll down the window and talking to the occupants. ""They need help."" I said, and told my wife to stay in the car as I jumped out.  One of the girls saw me and asked if I was a doctor. ""No, I'm not a doctor but I'll do what I can."" I started walking towards the person on the ground.

From here it gets a little graphic, to skip past this part. It's not my intention to shock or ""be graphic"", I just want to accurately convey my experience.


<graphic part>
I got close and saw a man laying on his side, almost in a fetal position.  His face was in a pool of blood. He was still breathing, with blood just gurgling out of his nose.
<end graphic part>

I made sure that the person on the phone was talking to 911 and I told everyone not to move him. I knelt next to him and grabbed his hand. It felt cold and he was unresponsive.  I started to tell him to hang in there. That he'll be ok. That help is on the way. I didn't know what else to say or do. 

Very soon after I heard sirens and could see flashing lights approaching. I started directing cars off to the side of the highway so they could get through. Several police cars showed up and began establishing themselves on-scene. Cars started moving out and I ran back and jumped back into my car and we drove past.  The first responders had already started to roll him over. His face was just covered in blood. I can't get that image out of my head. Or the feeling of his cold hand. 

My wife and I both hoped the guy made it.  He didn't. Joshua Walsh would have been 32 in a few days.  I think he was an only son. His mother is devastated.  Wish I could have done more. ",0

Out of the gutter,reduxde,"Bloomington, Indiana, 2004.

I was a homeless college dropout and has just gotten a job offer as ""dish washer"" at a bar.  The boss thought I was a college student at IU (thanks to some vagueness on my part).  I was not from Indiana at all, I'd ""ended up"" there; more specifically someone I thought I knew and could trust had brought me there and dumped me out on the sidewalk.

I showed up for my first day of work in my best clothes and a 7 year old pair of sandals, and was told that working a kitchen in sandals was a violation of some sort of code (health/safety etc).  The boss sent me across the street to get a pair of shoes, and the cheapest closed toed shoes they had were about $35 and I had about $15 to my name.  I walked out on the street in somewhat of a panic with no idea what to do, when an older gentleman walked by and said something like ""nice day"" and I said something like ""yeah, it almost was...""

We got into a conversation, he told me he was a professor at IU Bloomington, I told him I was now 20 minutes late to my first day of work as a dish washer across the street and that I couldn't go back until I came up with a pair of shoes.  He asked; I told him I was $20 short.  He busted out his wallet, gave me a $20, and I ran back in, got the shoes (the clerk knocked about $3 off the bill because I hadn't accounted for tax), and I ran across the street and started work.

I didn't have any money for food (which the boss figured out since I was constantly staring at the grill), and he let me cook food for myself using the grill on my own time.  I got through the week, ultimately was let go (the kitchen crew were all college kids, meanwhile I have some sort of ocd/tourettes/autism thing going on that makes it very hard for me to relate/communicate in a meaningful way; even when I'm being sincere I come across as a bad actor that can't remember his lines and is over-delivering them).  The 1 week paycheck and the free food was enough to get a couple button up shirts from Goodwill and get me feeling a lot stronger.  I wiggled my way into a door to door sales job (vacuum cleaners), did well enough at it to save some money, and started a business writing software/web pages (through my teenage years most of what I did was screw around on computers, but I didn't know how to use that to get an office job).

What followed was about 8 years of earning less than $5/hour and working 90 hour weeks.  Last year I filed taxes on a 6 figure 1099 income, I'm married, I have a 1 year old daughter, we rent a nice 2 bedroom 2 bathroom condo, I have a Roth IRA, and I'm writing this from a new laptop.

Back in 2004 I was very much at the end of my rope; discourage, frustrated, suicidal, and I felt like my 1 opportunity was being torn away from me on a technicality.  I have no idea who the professor was.  I'm not sure how much I overstepped ""feel free to use our grill to make yourself some food if you're hungry"".  Maybe I was ""destined"" to end up where I am, but deep down I feel like if I hadn't bumped into the guy and hadn't had a week of free food that I probably would have attempted to shoplift the shoes or given up on the job or just been too hungry to work & things could have unfolded very differently.

So, thanks, whoever you all are, if you're still alive.",0
Story time,blubberfeet,So this happened about a month ago. My and my friend finally met up after many months. At this time it would be our first pub visit complete with booze.

Just a push,Fusionof,"I was exhausted. My twins were 3 and I was pulling them up an icy hill in a sled. To make it harder, I had a baby in the stroller and was pushing the stroller with one hand and pulling the twins' sled with the other. The ice was wet and extra slippery, the cruel icy wind was on my face and tears weren't far - couldn't remember when I'd had a good night's sleep. 

I realized I wasn't gonna make it up the hill, my feet were slipping. Suddenly the sled started sliding upwards effortlessly. I turned and looked back.

Holland Tunnel Kindness,WetSinceTuesday,"  A few years back my wife and I were headed to NYC for a concert. After a whole lot of traffic we are approaching the (funnel) entrance to The Holland Tunnel. The was a woman in a SUV type vehicle trying desperately to edge her way into line but everybody in front of us ignored her. 
I slowed a bit and waved her in. We were only going 5mph so it was no big deal. When we got to the toll booth the taker waved us through and said she had paid for us. At the time the toll was like 
$12-$15. I thought,""Wow"". I consider myself to be a nice person, but that gesture alone continues to transcend kindness to me. Even to this day. For whatever reason, her gesture left a mark that am happy to carry.",0

Witnessed a Good Deed,TruthEarthOrg,"After visiting a restaurant near-by I went to to the bus stop to head back home and there was a rough-looking man that was hanging out in the area. I didn't have anything to give to him sadly but after a few minutes I saw a young man (in his 20s) with a long black ponytail just get out of his car and give this rough man his shoes. Just took them off and handed them to him and got back in his car and went on his way.

I breathed such a sigh of relief that there are people doing kind things for others and was honored to be able to witness it first-hand.

Was sitting here thinking and remembered a time where someone helped me. Wanted to tell my story. :),KidneyStew,"This is my first post here. I apologize for any formatting issues, on mobile. 

So, in 2012 I started dating this guy. He was horribly abusive, mentally, emotionally, and physically. Long story short, I had left my home that was almost 3 hours away to be with him. Things go horribly wrong, and he tells a whole bunch of lies to our roommate while I'm outside going for a walk. I get back, and they tell me to get out and never come back. I was freaking out. Middle of December, below freezing and I had no jacket, only a small blanket to wrap around me. Hours away from home, in a very scummy and ghetto neighborhood, and it's like 2 in the morning. 

I just sit outside a gas station with my blanket, bawling my eyes out trying to figure out what to do before I froze to death. There was this woman who noticed me. She asked me if I needed anything and I said no thanks but thank you for asking. She comes out of the gas station about 5 minutes later with a big bag completely full of drinks and snacks. I started crying even harder before. She wraps her arms super tight around me and just holds me for a minute. Then she tells me everything will be alright. I looked at her with my sloppy crying face and thanked her over and over and told her I would never forget her. 

And I haven't. Even though I said I didn't need anything, she knew I was hungry and needed that embrace way more than a full tummy. And any person who can see the truth in a person who claims to be okay will always be remembered by me!!🖤🖤

Always be sure to listen to yourself if something similar happens to you. The smallest thing can mean so much to someone, and whether it be a big bag full of things, feminine hygiene products, or something as simple as a hug... you could really make a difference. :) ",0

"When I was 6, I was in a terrible foster home. They were starving me. A man fed me by letting me ""steal"" his lunch every day.",Sandi_T,"Backstory: I was in a foster home where they considered me to be subhuman. They fed me 1/2 cup of dog kibbles every day. They went on the run across the USA. When they did, there was a time period we were in a town with a corner convenience store. My foster brother took me there every day to get cigarettes (this was the late 70s, so kids smoked still). 

I had become so hungry by that point that I was stealing a slice of bread out of the loaves of bread and then closing them back up. I would smash the bread flat and hide it under my clothes until I could eat it later. 

One day, I was getting bread out of one of the loaves, and the man at the store saw me. We stood and stared at each other. I dropped the bread and ran, terrified of the horrible trouble I would be in. 

Nothing happened. He didn't tell on me. The next time I was there (or another time, I was a kid, so time is meh), he left his food out on his desk for me. What he didn't know was that I wasn't allowed to eat anything except off of the floor. 

I do remember at some point knocking the food he had left down and eating it off of the floor... 

After that, the food started appearing on the floor of his office for me. 

I know now that the look on his face, that unrecognizable, confusing look... was compassion. It was heartache. 

No matter how many times I tell this story, no matter how the decades have passed since then... I cry about it every time. It warms my heart and overwhelms me with his kindness. 

Every once in a while, I have pork and beans, because he often gave me that and it was my favorite. 

Dear unnamed stranger, you gave me more than food, you gave me love and hope. Thank you. ",0

Having a rough day at work and a chat support tech had donuts delivered.,lazytothebones,"Between a broken server causing my work queue to be a mess and processing sad news from a loved one I was having a rough day. When I had trouble with completing a work task through an online service I turned to their chat support and the tech was super kind as they stayed with me until the issue was resolved. I thanked her for helping me since I was having a rough day. When she asked if there was anything else she could do I joked a bit and said ""only if you have donuts."" We laughed then since we are over 2000 miles apart and ""that would be a long commute.""Not even an hour later this big box of tasty donuts arrived at my work with my name on it! And my favorite kind was even in there! I did get back into the chat and was able to thank the beautiful person who reached right into my heart today from so far away.

She paid for my groceries... I'm stunned.,Arshness,"I was at Aldi's getting groceries and actually had the money to cover it despite having a terrible month in which I've even had to ask for help to get my family through... But my SNAP benefits came in and I was picking up some essentials... And my card wouldn't run. No idea why. The cashier helped me try it over and over and it was just not working despite having the funds and having worked ten minutes ago at another store...
I was getting frustrated and really nervous. What was won't with my card? Omg what if my benefits weren't actually there. What if they revoked them for some reason? What would we do for food...
Just as I'm starting to tremble as the second employee comes to try to get it to work a young lady comes up behind me and asks if my card is having trouble.
I say yes... She asks if she can cover my bill.
I say I'm so sorry for holding her up and I have the funds my cards just not working for some reason and I feel so bad for making everyone wait..
She says no please... I've been there. I'd be happy to do it. Please. If it's alright with you.
I say...I can't say no. I'm not in a great spot right now so it would help a lot anyway...
She says... I'm happy to help.
She paid for my bill and told me have a blessed day, very sweetly, not at all venomously. And I specify that because I'm a goth-witchy styled Satanist in The deep South and I usually get venom with my blessings.
So the way she said it made me so happy because whatever we each believe she meant it kindly.
I wish that wasn't rare here but it is and maybe that was as meaningful to me as the money she spent to help me out. Either way...I was doubly grateful to this sweet young lady for helping a fellow human regardless of how different we might be.
I wish her a beautiful life for she is a beautiful person and she deserves it!

Cheered Her Up,balimango7722,"This is my first post, I'm on mobile, etc. Please don't be too harsh. 


I was sitting in my community college math building, and I'm half awake while I'm waiting for my next class. I usually carpool with my sister and she has a morning class, so we go in early. 


While I'm sitting in the lobby, a girl comes into the lobby obviously upset and tearing up. She's speaking to her friend, trying not to be loud but she's right next to me, so I over hear her anyways. 


She's saying how her mom just kicked her out of the house, came to the school and took her car back home (not really her car, I'm assuming the mothers), how she didn't know where she was going to go, and that she didn't even have a job. I felt sorry for her seeing that I've had my own problems with family recently and moving. She's crying, and while her friend comforted her, I slowly crept away to the vending room. I got a bottle of water and a pack of crackers, then come back. Me is me, Crying Girl is CG. 


Me: ""Hey, are you OK?"" 

 CG: ""Oh! I'm alright, I'm so sorry, I'm just having some family problems right now...""

Me: *I offer her the water bottle and crackers* ""Here, I got these for you. I figured you'd probably need this, I didn't want you to get dehydrated. I always feel better after a water bottle when I cry.""

CG: ""For me!? Oh my God, thank you!""


She started crying even harder about the water bottle and crackers. She hugged me and asked me what my name was. She then called me an angel, told me that she wished there were more good people like me in the world, and that I had turned her whole day around. When a friend she had gotten a ride from came by, she was telling him all about me and how sweet I was. 


I'm really glad I made her whole day better just by doing that for her, and I hope her situation gets better!",0

And yes that very 'dollar note' wasn't acceptable but that was what i had. So i tell him that i dont have more money with me and if he could just give me 10 minutes, i could pay him (by borrowing from some friend of college-yes it was near that shop. But nope, he wouldn't trust me. So a guy who was standing there to pay his bill, aswell, to my delight- asked the shopkeeper to deduct my bill from his money.. (which was about 1.5 dollars)... I know it wasn't a considerable price but i still remember it as if it happened just yesterday.. And it made all the difference, i never forgot to pass the kindness along.. I dont remember saying thank-you to that guy, may be because at that very moment i was anxious, angry and a teenager.

The man who played the bugle at Grandpa's funeral...,Morrighaine,"For some years now, the US military has not provided a live bugler to play Taps at funerals of veterans receiving full military honors. The playing of Taps means quite a bit to the grieveing family. A bugler with a prerecorded version of Taps is sent with a fake instrument, on which a button is pressed and a ""high quality recording"" plays.  It's due to a shortage of musicians, and funds. 

A man in my (deceased) grandfather's area volunteers to come to military funerals and play, so that families and the veterans are properly honored. I know he will accept a small donation if it is offered, but for the most part, he does it from kindness. It made such a difference at my own grandfather's funeral two weeks ago. You might not think a live musician would be so important, but to me, it was a real kindness. ",0
My grandpa did the greatest thing he could had done to help everyone,,"So, let me start my post with a sad note: it's been almost 4 years since he passed away. But though I miss him, I know he's in a better place now.

Okay, now on to the story:

Way back when, before I was even born, my whole family came to live in the house I live with my mom, stepdad, uncle and grandma today. When they came here, the park in front of the house was basically desert, save for a couple coconut trees.

So what did my grandpa do? He went and BOUGHT, out of his own money, small trees that he planted by himself or with the help of his children at said park. Then, after everything was planted, he took care of each tree until their roots had reached the water of the soil. And after that, he still watered some of them every so often, just to make sure.

After I was born, I became his assistant and we planted a few more trees on this park and also on another small one close to our house. We took care of all trees until he was too ill to keep doing it, but by then all of those trees were already doing very well on their own, so they're all still up.

My post is short, but it's just something to put out there the amazing service my old man did for all of us. I'm insanely proud of him for doing this. If anyone would like to know a little more about him, feel free to ask in the comments, I'll gladly answer what I know.",0

Secret Santa,cdub2373,"My husband was hospitalized just before Christmas and ultimately had surgery that showed he has advanced cancer.

I was astounded how he’d managed to do this, especially considering he didn’t even have any money on him!

After he’d recovered enough to have a conversation, I asked him about it. He was as surprised as I was. He said someone in the operating room had asked if he had his Christmas shopping done and he said no; he still needed a stocking-stuffer for me. He told them I like snowmen.

Thank you random bus driver!,calicocookiedough,"This happened about a year ago.  I had walked out on a shitty retail job because my coworkers were making me hate my life, and I had just gotten hired as a server at another shitty job.  The vibe there was super weird where people were out to get you and a lot of people were surprised when you didn't no call, no show for the second day of training.  Anyways, it was my first time being a server and I hated it and sucked too.  The work environment was toxic, most of the guests were mean and rude, and I felt like an idiot for working with high schoolers when I have a degree.  

I'm supposed to be off at 9pm but rolling all the silverware and completing my side tasks got me out at 10pm.  I walked 3 blocks to the bus stop andddddd it was raining.  I checked the bus schedule and I had like 30 mins of sitting in the rain.  The bus started coming (the opposite way that I needed) and the bus driver saw me and stopped in front of me (across the street).  I got on and the driver told me that the bus will loop around and just pick me up anyway, so I should get on to get out of the rain.  It was probably such a small thing to her, but I was so so grateful that somebody went (even slightly) out of their way to make my day a little easier.  It meant so much because I was in such a bad place at the time, and I felt like it was a reminder that there is also good in the world.    ",0

Today I invited a complete stranger into my car...,Ranita99,"I was driving to work today when I spotted this woman running towards the bus. I passed her and while waiting at the light, I saw the bus pass us both by. I could see her in my rearview mirror as she started to slow down and slump forward, realizing that she missed her chance at catching the bus. Even though she was a block away, I could feel her sadness envelope me as if I were in her shoes. We’ve all been there- we’ve all felt that. That feeling of dread and failure, knowing you’re going to be late and that it’s no one’s fault but your own. I’m no stranger to that pit in your stomach. So I pulled over and when she was a bit closer, I rolled down the window and asked if she wanted a ride. Her mouth dropped into an astonished smile as she ran towards my car and thanked me repeatedly. She told me the bus is never early and that she thought she had enough time. She thought she planned it right. Those words struck a chord in me. I understood. We all try to plan right. We all think we have enough time. Whether it’s catching the bus to work, or making a huge life decision. We all think we planned it right. And we always think we have enough time. That isn’t always the case- but today, for this stranger, it was. 

We caught up to the bus after a few blocks and I made sure we were in front of it so that she didn’t miss it this time. She got out of my car telling me that this was the kindest thing a person has ever done for her. I hope she meant the kindest thing a stranger has ever done for her. We didn’t exchange names- we just sat side by side during her brief moment of need. And as jaded as I am about this terrifying, chaotic world- I’m so grateful that I was at the right place, at the right time, to be able to help this woman’s Monday get off to a good start.

She had good words to say to me and I really really appreciated her kindness in my moment of emotions she was so sweet and I kept thinking about her for months and put together a gift with a scarf and bracelet and dropped it off to her, she gave me a hug with huge smiles and I told her how much I appreciated her that day and I left

Later on she messaged my bf trying to find me on FB but I deleted FB a long time ago, she was saying thank you and how happy she was! It made me happy that there are people like her in the world because she really is such a sweet person and it felt good to give to someone like her ",0

My RAoK from about six months ago.,bubonis,"It was Saturday afternoon and I had just left work and was on the way home. My route puts me on the Garden State Parkway; for those who aren't familiar with it, it's a pretty massive multi-lane freeway that runs north-to-south on the eastern side of New Jersey. I was driving comfortably when I spotted something odd: a man riding a longboard-style skateboard on the shoulder of the highway, gas can in hand. Knowing that this was illegal and possibly fatal for him, I pulled over and told him to get in which he did.

Turns out his truck ran out of gas about a mile back (I passed it and didn't even notice it) and he was on his way to the rest center to get a refill. I drove him to the station, waited while he got some gas, then drove him back to his truck (which means I had to drive a couple of miles to make the U-turns). After filling his truck we found that it wouldn't start. I checked some relays and fuses and everything was fine; the car would crank but not fire. I did a bit of Google-troubleshooting and learned that his particular make/model of truck has a known ""quirk"" where the car won't run again if the tank goes completely dry, and the only fix is to replace the fuel pump. Lovely. The guy was now stranded.

I asked if he had someone he could call and he told me he didn't have a phone. I let him use mine. He called his (friend? sister? someone) to let them know what was going on, then he called the towing company to get his truck towed to the rest station. While there he made a couple of phone calls to taxi services and found out it was going to cost upwards of $60 to get him back home, money which he didn't have (and neither did I). He made a couple more phone calls and finally reached someone in person, but that person couldn't come to get him.

So, I drove him home. It was about a one hour drive from where we were (which would put me about 30 minutes south of my house) but we talked along the way so the time went by quickly enough. He offered me money several times and I told him to forget it; I even got a chance to use the line, ""today you, tomorrow me"" which some redditors might remember. We got to his house and he told me he was going to run inside for some money for me and I told him I would be gone by the time he got back. He laughed and thanked me again. I gave him my business card and told him to call me and let me know what happened to his truck, as I was curious about it (never heard about running the tank dry and it not starting again). He left the car and went inside his home; I pulled out and went home.

The end.

Sidenote: I never heard back from him about his truck. I think it was a Suburban, one of those big SUVs, definitely GMC or Chevy. Anyone have any ideas about the fuel pump thing?

Left some notes and cash in baby care areas,Pencilbump,"Sharing this in hopes it may inspire others... 

I anonymously left little notes of encouragement with cash in various places where parents with babies might go (taped inside changing table in bathroom, the baby food and diapers aisles at Walmart, and in baby clothes). I remember how difficult it is caring for babies, and how it meant the world to me when an older lady once approached me and my baby to just say how lucky my son was to have me as a mother. I'm sure that's just something nice she said to any random mother she saw, but it really meant so so much to me at the time when motherhood was all new and I felt like nothing I was doing was right. All these years later I still get teary eyed remembering it. Anyway, the notes I left were inspired by that sweet lady's words and said something along the lines of...

Who Saved My Life Oahu?,Gane26,"In the summer of 2000 I was 18 housesitting with my sister on Oahu. It was our first time there and we had an amazing summer riding the bus all over the island and exploring new beaches every day. A friend of my godmother had a son there home from college who had grown up there and him and his friends wanted to show us girls a good time. They took us to the spitting caves. I am not a strong swimmer and didn’t grow up near the ocean. I was afraid looking down into the melting pot of waves coming in and spitting out from the cave. We even saw the plaques for all the people who had died there and it still didn’t click. I was pressured to jump by the guys who promised to jump first then help me to swim out. The 3 of us nearly drowned. I never caught a breath after surfacing, being hit by waves in what felt like all directions. The current was pulling us out and after panicking, I remember the feeling of succumbing to my fate, looking at the tiny people on top of the cliff and knowing that I would never be on land again. I was worn out and I couldn’t try anymore, I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t swim. Then I see what I believe to be Samoan guy with long hair, in a ponytail with several ties down it, thin muscular build, jump off the cliff doing flips. I remember feeling upset by his arrogance at first- we were drowing and he was showing off lol- then he came to me. He had to hold me and swim to the reef area near the cliff to climb back up and the waves kept pulling us back out. On the 3rd try I dug my hands and feet in and held on with everything I had. I came out topless, with my hands and feet cut up and covered in blood, all my jewelry ripped off from the force of the current, with several black guys who were the stereo typical looking “gangstas” of that era wearing chains with a big video camera (yes, they were big in the year 2000) taping the whole thing. I yelled at them for videoing me, and I was so traumatized I fled the scene immediately with my sister. My hero was successfully saving the other 2 guys who talked me into jumping and planned to swim me out.

I never got to thank him. I have thought about it many times over the years and I know without a doubt I owe my life to this mysterious stranger. The last 17 years I have spent on this earth have been bc of him and I can’t express how much that means. About 2 years ago I felt a very strong feeling that has been profound to me in a way I can’t fully put into words that I need to thank this person, that maybe he needs something fr me now although I’m not sure what. Even if it’s only me telling him what a difference he has made. I haven’t had a clue where to post this, and if anyone has any suggestions I am all ears. Thank you for reading.",0

To the bus driver who saw me struggling,,"I was picking my dog up from getting neutered. For reference, I’m 5’2 and weigh 98 pounds. He’s a rescue (I think he’s a pointer/fox terrier) and at 7 months weighs 40 pounds. But it’s freezing out and my car was parked far. I still didn’t want him to have to walk in the cold after surgery so I carried him, though it was difficult for me. 

Then I hear a voice say “can I give you a ride?” I turn and say that I’m ok and my car is close. She insists, saying I look like I’m struggling and he’s hurting. It helped so much to not have to walk more. 

So thank you so much, bus driver. I wish I got your name. You had made a stranger’s day a little easier with your kindness. ",0

Christmas Kindness (repost from r/randomkindness),thisisnotpaulyshore,"So my car is really crappy, particularly the battery. I was getting ready to buy a new one last night, and had to run to the bank. I had left my jump box at home, since my car seemed to be starting fine that day. Well, lo and behold, I couldn't leave the bank because it felt like not starting.

I got pissy and went inside, and asked if I could use one of their phones (another thing I stupidly left behind), when an old lady in a wheelchair with a breathing apparatus offered me hers. She overheard me saying I needed a jump, and again offered it to me. We got it started. I thanked her and she gave me the longest hug I've ever had, and said ""We're supposed to be here for each other, aren't we?""

It just blew me away that out of all of these people at the bank, this one person who clearly in a bad spot and who could barely walk was the one who sympathized with me and actually did something. Thank you Judy.

Lost game lead to some nice reflection,Watertrousers,"Long story short: bought Assassin's Creed Origins today for the PS4, ended up misplacing it on the bus on the way home (I think). I have fairly pronounced anxiety, particularly right now, so I start retracing my steps trying to find it and am freaking out a smidgen. A homeless guy notices me and helps me to look, while making conversation. Turns out he has only been without a home for the past year-ish after losing his wife and has been struggling along, just trying to make the best of it. He had problems with substance abuse and it finally caught up to him after such a fucking horrid loss.
Really put things into perspective - this guy has all the reason in the world to see someone visibly freaking out and ignore it. Especially over something so minor, in the end. Instead, his first instinct is to help. Not once does he ask me for a single thing.
It may seem a small matter, but his instant desire to help really touched me. When going through a rough patch, it can be a shock to realise that people - strangers and hugely put-upon though they are - care about you. He was also obviously down about us not being able to find the game (""there's enough shit luck going about without you wasting money!"") but I'm just glad for the connection. 
My anxiety makes it difficult for me to put myself out there at times and I wish I was more vocal about my appreciation for what he did. If I see him again, I definitely will be. What a fucking nice dude.

I will certainly be trying to follow his example in the future. You really don't ever know when the slightest warmth may lift someone from a flagging mood or shitty time. ",0

This is a rural area with no public transportation. The agent went to the trouble of making a phone  call to get approval and then adjusting the total so I could get the car and drive to the hospice.

Helped an almost stranger to avoid violence,dalux21,"I've met a girl from Eastern Europe here in Spain and we went on a date, although we kissed it was clear that she's very prude and introvert and nothing more was ever gonna happen.
She told me about how this was her first time abroad and came here two weeks ago with some friends and they stayed at one of the AirBnBs owned by her friend's brother. The deal was that she could stay longer for free in exchange for some housekeeping.
She's short on money and whilst she was here with her friends the host offered her to go to for a few days in Italy  together before heading back to their country, she accepted cause she didn't have money to afford the trip to Italy. After all their friends left and they stayed alone he started acting a bit bossy and asking more and more in terms of cleaning the rooms etc.
On our third meeting she looked really tired and I asked her why, she said she couldn't sleep much cause she had another ""small argument"" with her friend, who also got drunk.
We walked into a cafe and when she took off her scarf I noticed she had two big greenish bruises on her neck, clearly from choking. I asked for explanations but she said that nothing happened,  everything was alright and not to worry about it, she refused to give any sort of explanation but was clear that the ""small argument"" wasn't that small and the guy is a violent prick.
I offered to help her to get in touch with authorities or to stay on my sofa but she just went on saying that everything was ok.
I asked her to meet again and eventually convinced her to let me help her and pay for her accommodation in Italy although on a short notice it's rather expensive so she could get her own room, she said I didn't have to do this cause she's no one to me but I just can't stand pricks who are violent with women and although I barely know her the thought that he could have touched her again in that way drove me nuts, the though of any men doing harm in this way to any girl makes me sick.
The weird thing is that all the people I asked advice to were like: ""nay nevermind, just don't get involved and forget about it""
Like wtf, he fuckin hit her FFS, what you mean nevermind? 

PS unfortunately calling authorities would have been useless cause she was not gonna speak about it and it would have got her in troubles back home, weird small village Eastern European culture

RAOK helping to get a guy home tonight.,,"I'm on vacation in The Hague, and tonight while coming back to my hostel, I witnessed an oldish guy, about 60 or so, drop his bicycle lock key. Through the sidewalk grate it went. 

I tried to get the grate cover off, but it was stuck fast. Cue 3 other people offering to help as I went drain fishing. One went and bought some knitting wool from her house, another comes back with some nails and cup hooks, and then a police officer shows up to help with the hubbub.

Various bits of jiggery pokery later, after Jerry rigging a fishing line, I managed with the police officer's help to get this guy's key out of the grate. The officer told me that the man would have had to wait until city hall opened again in the morning, for someone to come cut the lock off his bike.

2 days I've been here and already I'm helping people I don't know in a country I don't even know! But the public and the police here went the extra tonight to get this dude home. It's cold, about 5c and I'd hate him to have had to walk home!

Mods are still active here, and I had to remake this post again (the last one was 3 years old), because we've seen an increase in requests coming in lately.  

This might seem very strict or even mean but this is because there are a lot of subreddits, and many of them involve acts of kindness and serve their own unique purpose.

Especially people asking for things (be it material or digital) come by here often, when they are actually looking for /r/RandomKindness, which is specialized in doing requests and offers. They are way bigger than we are, and thus your request will receive more views.

Each subreddit has their own theme going on, and ours is having posts of acts of kindness stories, that have been done by you or someone else you know.  Or even a cross post from another subreddit is allowed, or article you read somewhere. 

**So that means past tense, as in, *it already happened*.**

It would help a lot of people help us out and report these request posts accordingly.

Hurricane Irma- kindness to the nth degree,randomusernameinUSA,"Hurricane Irma was due to arrive -within hours. Husband and son  were still boarding up the house but then I realized that we only had a few sandbags to protect from flooding and we need many more. That very moment I looked at my cell phone and I saw a text from my friends who said they were enjoying the views of the ocean but asked if I needed help. I texted them back and asked for suggestions about where to get sandbags.  They replied immediately and said they knew of a nearby location and that they would meet me there. I got there before they did and I started shoveling but looked around and saw some people had no shovels, so I lent my extra shovels to them. My back pain was intense from days of hurricane prep that involved hard physical labor and from the stressful sleepless nights trying to figure out how to be safe from Irma. The sand was wet and heavy and quite hard to shovel into a bag by myself.  Time passed and the skies looked ominous. The wind kicked up and I slowly shoveled the sand into the burlap bags as the bags whipped in the wind. Then I heard a voice: ""We will help you!""  A lady who had borrowed my shovels was asking her whole family to help me, now that they were done. They asked me to pull the car closer to where the sand was and they took over the entire job. They were not young but they were very strong. Before long 10 bags were filled and loaded in my car. I thanked the strangers repeatedly. Then I looked up and saw my friends (the beach goers) had arrived. Together we filled ten more bags and loaded them into my  car. With relief I drove home and helped with the final prep for the storm. Little did I know that the random acts of kindness were still flowing my way. That same night, my friends dropped off a delicious meal for us. They must have realized we were totally exhausted and very worried about surviving the hurricane. These friends had family in the area but I guess they knew that we lacked any family in the state where we live and that the family we had were still grieving from a recent death in my husband's family.  Not only was it so nice to get the help with the sandbags, we truly appreciated the way our friends delivered that hot meal. We ate that tasty comforting meal and it warmed our hearts to feel so loved. Hurricane Irma really showed us just how  people can be very kind and caring. We pledge to pay their kindness forward. ",0

To the stranger that saved me and my brothers lives: Thank you with all my heart <3,motorcityanna,"I live and work in Detroit, and for a the longest time, my younger brother had begged me to record video of him skate boarding around memorable places within the city. So we choose a Saturday when I was off work, I pick him up in my car, and we head downtown. Things were going great initially and I ended up getting some awesome shots of him doing his thing. We grab some lunch and decided to head out for just a little while longer to get a few more clips. That's when everything went wrong. My brother was setting up to do a trick over a mailbox on a sidewalk. He started from a ways back to build up enough speed and cleared the mailbox on the first try! Just as I let out a supportive cheer for him, I saw him fall and heard a sickening *SNAP*, followed by one of the worst screams I have ever heard come out of his mouth as he tumbled into the road. I quickly ran over to see if he was okay, to find him on the ground in immense pain. He had broken his leg, and the bone was clearly protruding out of it. There was so much blood, that I just froze. I couldn't stop thinking that I should do something, but I couldn't move. I didn't know what to do, nor did I take into account that I was now in the road, on a busy street, looking over my brother. I heard someone shouting at me from  behind me which snapped me out of my daze in time for me to look over my shoulder to see a city bus bearing down on me, no more than 7-10 feet away. I immediately felt that I was going to die, as there was no way I was getting out of the way in time. This was it for me. I closed my eyes, awaiting my fate, when I felt a hand grip me tightly around my arm to pull / push me out of the way and back onto the sidewalk, barely being missed by the bus. My brother later told me, that our savior had jumped over the car parked in front of us to push me out of the way. 'It was F#@KING BADASS!' were his exact words :). When I opened my eyes and realized I wasn't dead, I see this tall Korean man helping me to my feet. After quickly inspecting my brother's condition he knew exactly what to do. Taking the belt from around his waist he made a makeshift tourniquet on my brother's upper thigh, then took off his sweatshirt to ball it up and elevate his leg. Within a flash the stranger had already taken off his shirt to apply pressure on the wound. I couldn't help but blush a little as this man was clearly fit and very handsome. The man, now shirtless in the street turned to me and calmly asked me to call 911 for an ambulance, giving me our exact location within the city. At this point my brother had already lost a lot of blood and was starting to panic and slip in and out of consciousness. The man, still applying pressure to my brother's wound, grabbed his hand and said 'Stay with me' firmly, with a smile on his face. He then asked my brother 'Hey, what are you planning on having for dinner tonight?' and my brother, already calming down, replied 'My mom's making ziti.' The man then replied, 'Heck yeah. I'll bet it's pretty damn good' to which my brother replied 'It's the best.' The man said 'Keep focusing on that. The ambulance will be here shortly' very calmly. I was amazed. Any trace of panic was now gone from my brother's voice and demeanor. Our heroic stranger proceeded to sit with us for the next 30 minutes, until the ambulance arrived, making sure my brother did not lose consciousness or go into shock. When my brother was finally loaded into the ambulance, the man; his hands covered in my brother's blood.. and still shirtless *drool* lol, started to take his leave. Still a little bit shaken and overwhelmed, I nervously apologized about his clothes and asked him what his name was. He told me it was, Derek, smiled, and said 'No problem. Life's more important than clothes after all' before walking away.

After my brother was admitted to the hospital, the doctor informed my family and brother, that had it not been for the stranger's quick thinking and actions, that my brother may have lost his leg, and possibly his life as his peripheral artery was badly damaged. At that point I had to inform the doctor and family that I too, could have been killed if not for this amazing man.

Fast forward to present day. My brother is recovering excellently, with a few new pieces of metal in his leg as a souvenir. I however, cannot stop thinking about the mysterious man who saved us, regretting that I did not think to ask for a means of contacting him at the time. My brother jokes with me constantly that I should have 'asked him out. pretty awesome guy.' So now I'm asking you, fellow Detroit Redditors. I know this is a long shot, but if anyone knows a tall Korean man (strikingly tall.. at least 6 ft if not more) by the name of Derek, would it be okay if I asked you to send him a message for me? If nothing else to express my extreme gratitude for his kindness, and at least buy him a beer.. or a shirt lol. On second thought, it's okay by me that he remains shirtless.",0

Anonymously paid for my meal (and pie),patchoulicolt,"One very wet, very late night/early morning in Texas, I went to a Pie House. It's important to the story that you know I'm a guy, twenty something, and average looking.

I was quite upset and distraught at the moment, because the person of my desires had declined to even be my friend. Which isn't the point. But I know I looked sad.

I have pretty hefty social anxiety, so in public I keep to myself, and just keep my eyes on my phone or my food (like a men's restroom).

At the end of my meal when I got my ticket, a different waiter I hadn't talked to  came and took it. Just took it. 

He never brought it back, so I eventually asked my waitress what happened. She went to the ticket thief, and got a really unusual look on her face as she talked to him.

She told me it had been taken care of. The payer wished to remain anonymous.

Someone had paid for my meal. And pie.

I instantly got a shooting feeling of the kind of fear you get when something goes bump in the night, because I knew I was being watched. It mixed into flattery, confusion, and shock. I left feeling like a detective - examining everyone's face to see if they did it.

I asked the waitress at least 5 times if she was sure it was ME who the kind stranger wanted to pay for. That just DOES NOT happen to me. At all. Whatsoever. Nope. Nope. Nope. No.

I still think it may have been a mistake meant for a beautiful woman. Of which I am neither beautiful nor a woman. Remaining anonymous, they couldn't  have had a motive like flattery or sex.

I know it was an especially impactful, kind, remarkable gesture. It made me feel so much better. I wish so much I could have known who it was, and what went through their mind as they watched me. Were they shy and thought I was cute? Did they see how sad I was? We're they paying forward an act of kindness?

I'm still waiting to see a sad person in a restaurant who I can pay it forward to.",0
Thank you (xpost from r/oregoneclipse),bk05,"I can't describe the gratitude my girlfriend and I feel for Nate, Jess, Jason and Dave for helping us get our Subaru out of a sand pit in Deschutes National Forest on Monday night. They were down on their hands and knees digging away the loose sand so we could get unstuck; they tore twigs off branches to put under the tires to give us traction. We were in over our heads and these kind people went so far above and beyond, with no expectation of anything in return. I hope you see this and that we can find a way to connect -- we owe you our weekend, and we can't say thank you enough.",0
RAOK recieved while jogging,IAmMiddy,"I am a rather introverted, insecure guy. Today, i went jogging in my local park. I started jogging about three months ago, at that point i would only go really late in the evening, because i did not want a lot of attention. This has gotten better though, and i went for my run in the early evening. 

I only met a few other runners in the park, because it was rainy, something i really appreciate. However, after about one hour, i saw a group of rughly 10 drunk, loud football fans comming from the opposite direction as i was running, blocking the way. I thought to myself something along the lines ""please just let me through"", as i was running towards them. What happened when i got closer though really made my day: 

One of them yelled (in a kind way) ""Highfive"", they all made space for me in the middle of them, and just raising both of my hands i recieved highfives from all of them. They even cheered for me and encouraged me to keep running, putting such a big smile on my face.

It might be a little thing, but it made me so happy and gave me such a positve boost, that i wanted to share it with someone :)

Edit: Thanks for the kind words, I'm glad people liked the short, happy telling.",0
This sub changed me,beautifulsouth00,"Hi RAOK!  I just want everyone here to know, I discovered this sub about three years back, in the fall/winter.  I love to read the little things that make people appreciate each other, cuz being human on this planet, it really sucks sometimes.  It feels like every day is just depressing, with Nazi's and Trump, the plight of refugees, or just working class stiffs being exploited for a barely living wage and then forced to rent ridiculously priced living spaces owned my the very ones exploiting us for labor.  We're all constantly being beaten down, and I decided to make a change, and this sub inspired it!

   Rather than let it all get to me, i decided, just before the end of the year, that I'd try to say ONE nice thing to ONE person each and every day.   It was nearing New Year's,  so I made it that year's Resolution.  Say or do something nice for someone, not expecting anything at all back.  In the warehouse I work at, I walk through to my work station, and I shout encouragement to people I pass by.  I see people I trained and beam, ""I'm so proud of you!""   And when I don't see anyone I know or could recognize and encourage, well, I compliment someone on their outfit, and I mean it.  One kid, prior felon I believe, my company gives people second chances. He's a good kid... he just walks around with a scowl on his face and it scares people.  I said something that made him laugh in front of a group of people the other day- and I stopped suddenly and just told him right there in front of everybody, that he's got a great smile, and that he should smile more.  I don't think there's been a day since then that he hasn't smiled at me.  But I didn't stop with my coworkers.  It was fun.  So I kept it up and did it everywhere I went.
 
   I hand out extra bags at the grocery store registers, and leave everyone standing there wondering what's gotten into me.  I put quarters in the machines that 4 year olds fidget on at the store, so they can ride the rocket while they wait for mommy or play the crane game.  I pet dogs that I pass by, help someone who I see struggling to carry something, and tell strangers I pass on the street that they're rockin' that hair do.  When a police officer is behind me, or an ambulance or fire truck crew, in the fast food drive through or line, I pay for their order.  That's the most expensive thing I do, but most of it, really costs nothing.  
   
   What I find especially rewarding is telling customer service people on the phone or at the window that they're doing a great job.  And I don't mind holding or waiting, or repeating that account number one more time, that they can take their time, and that I really appreciate their assistance.  Customer service is a really thankless job.  And it makes their day, as well as mine.

   Ever since I decided to do this 3 or 4 years ago, well, my life has improved in ways you would not think it could.  I'm an ""elder goth"" and now I walk around smiling.  I'm in my 40's, and for the first time in my life, people started telling me I was beautiful.  I lost 50 pounds, grew my hair out, but really, it was the attitude change.  I laugh more.  I smile at strangers.  And I'm different.  I'm more active and procrastinate less.  People were talking to me and telling me how great they thought I was, and I walked taller, got better at my job, and received a promotion.  ""You're always so happy,"" a girl I don't even know told me at work the other day.  My bank account is fatter, and I have more friendship in my life too. 

   All from a New Year's Resolution that I made one year, that I decided to repeat the next year, and the next.  I don't even have to think about it any more.  It's easy.  I'm just KINDER to people, and my life is richer for it.  And it all started one day, when I found this sub. 

TL/DR: Made a New Year's Resolution years ago to be kind to someone at least once a day. Have continued ever since.  My life improved in ways I never thought it would.",0
Kindness of Elementary Students on a Very Hard Day,KatanaAvion,"As some of you may know, my 9 year old son, Korbyn, was in third grade when he passed away in February.

My daughter starts kindergarten on Monday, and will be attending the same school my son had attended. Today was open house. I have dreaded today all summer. Walking through those doors was terrifying and painful. I fought tears the entire time I was there. 

Until I couldn't hold them back anymore when I walked last his locker. Students started recognizing me from when I spoke with them about my son's death the last week of school. 

Those students showered me and my daughter in hugs and kind words. The faculty stepped in and did the same. Kids showed my daughter around the school and befriended her. They turned a horrible afternoon into one of hope. Such a small act of kindness, changed this entire day for me.

I have been offered the chance to start a project with the school. Something that is important and will leave a lasting impression on these students of my son's wonderful and kind legacy. 

I chose to start ""Korbyn's Kindness Project"". My son was bullied. He was a chunky kid with a skin tag on the end of his nose that he refused to let the doctors remove. He was also sensitive and cried easily. He still came home and told me that the mean kids were his friends, because he knew they were good people. I raised an amazing child, who could still befriend and play happily with kids who were mean to him the day before. He was a much better person than I am.  

I need ideas of something elementary students can do individually and as a whole - simple acts of kindness. Maybe we can instill kindness as a permanent value in our children as they grow into productive adults.

Any ideas that are kid friendly, and cheap (as many that are free as possible!)? Each idea should show kindness, and be doable by ages 5 to 12. 
 
We are also hoping to find 3 inch smooth stones to paint, that symbolizes how each person is different, unique, but can be something even more wonderful when working together - how nobody is left out when creating beauty. If anyone knows where I might find 350 of these stones, please direct me there! This will be our first project to kick off the year of kindness throughout his school, and will surround the memorial butterfly garden we planted over the summer on the playground. 

Thank you all in advance for what I am positive will be fabulous ideas!

An attempt at kindness changed my day.,Me-Here-Now,"The events of the last week or so have been difficult for me, as I'm sure they have been for many others as well.

I was born into and grew up in a cult, a fundamentalist Christian thing. I'm older than most folks here and grew up during the cold war with bomb shelters and stuff. Add to that the second coming of Jesus any day now, and the earth being ""cleansed fire"". All of that makes the situation with North Korea unsettling.

I also grew up witnessing the civil rights movement. But the cult I was raised in believed and taught that God liked white people best. The phrase ""white and delightsome"" was used. I've moved past that thinking now, and believe that if there is a God then we are all the same. But Nazis marching in the streets and hurting people is also horrifyingly unsettling. 

I let my mind slip into a place of hopelessness and sadness. 

Then something happened that changed my thinking, and reminded me that most of us are good.  I know it is going to sound small, but I was at a fast food place, at a table, I had ordered milk that came in a plastic bottle. My arthritis was acting up and I could not open it. After several attempts it final gave, and I got the lid off. Then I became aware of a young man walking toward me, ""Did you get it?"" he asked. See, I told you it was small, a stranger in a fast food place being concerned that the grey haired lady couldn't open her milk. But it was enough to bring me back to the present. And to want to pass on the kindness and caring on instead of moving through the day like a dark cloud. We are ok. 

Namaste",0
Sure is neat when it happens to you,backpackwayne,"Last week I was in the drive through at In and Out Burger. The cashier at the window told the lady in front of me paid for my food. I was stunned. Had to get out of the car and thank her because it was just such a wonderful feeling. Nothing to do with the money. The fact that someone would do something so random to make my day. 

I'll be paying it forward for sure. :D

RAOK at the airport,Akousticstorm,"(Thank you again to the nicest stranger I've encountered in a long time.) My wife and six month old baby and I were at the airport tonight on our way home and due to a series of crappy events we missed our flight by about 5 seconds. (Stress level maxed out already from the things we went through) We literally ran up to the desk to check my sons stroller as they were closing the door to the boarding ramp but they wouldn't let us on. So my wife is crying and worried we are going to be waiting all night for another flight and possibly run out of formula, baby is crying because he's hungry and I'm trying to sort this mess out. A little while after everyone is calmed down, a complete stranger who is a native to the city we were leaving approaches us and says she overheard what happened and she wanted to buy us dinner. Then she said she could call her son and he would go to the store to buy us formula and bring it to the airport. We told her we would be ok but were blown away grateful for the offer. Wanted to share as it's nice to know people like this are out there ",0
My RAOK today: Drove a stranger back home.,bubonis,"I know it doesn't sound like much, but....

This morning I had to stop at my mother's house on the way to work, and afterwards I had to get gas for my car. The gas station is in the opposite direction of the way I needed to go for work, but it was only a couple of miles so no biggie. The drive from mom's to the gas station is almost entirely on a main road that runs alongside a river and is designed for cars and, for part of the way, bicycles. There are virtually no sidewalks on that road.

As I was driving I passed an older woman who was walking along the side of the road. She was maybe in her early 50s, carrying a large purse, and walking the slow and determined trudge of someone who has walked a long ways in nearly 90 degree heat. When I passed her she was just approaching a turnoff to a residential area, specifically the last residential area on that stretch of road, so I figured that was her destination.

After I got gas I turned back the way I came to go to work. Shortly afterwards I saw her again, now past that residential area, looking miserable. I slowed down, rolled down the window, and asked her if she needed a ride. With a grateful smile she nodded. I turned around, tossed my junk off the passenger seat, and let her in. I asked her where she was headed and she named a town that was three towns over. She told me that she had started walking from a road I was familiar with -- three miles away. I told her to relax and take in some air conditioning as I drove her to her destination. It turns out I drove her about ten miles to her destination and she had every intention of walking that entire distance before I pulled up.

I hope ""Diana"" had a better day after that.  :-)",0

Backstory : a few week back there was an askreddit post asking ""What food are you craving that isn't available where you are?""

And that reminded me that time when i was a child when i was a my friend house (who happen to also be a redditor, hey /u/tonytonyd) he made me taste those american cereals and that was seriously the best cereals i ever tasted, since i live in France these are hard to come by, you can get them in american groceries import stores but they cost way too much, i once almost bought some because i wanted my girlfriend to taste them but when we saw the price tag and in our difficult financial situation we gave up on that,

and then shortly after posting this, redditor /u/rhino2990 said she was gonna send me some, i gave her my adress and today arrived the package, we could not believe this generosity between internet strangers, anyway i could not wait to try the cereals again, wanted to make a picture of me eating a bowl but i ate it too fast and forgot to take the pictures aaaand i'm out of milk to make another bowl, at least i got a picture of all the amazing stuff :

RAOK....With Balloons!,deanie1970,"On Monday, a friend had filmed a commercial. They'd used giant helium balloons for it and he brought them to me on his way home from the shoot. I kept them in my office...didn't know what to do with them.  The next evening, a friend stopped by with his disabled, mentally-challenged daughter (she's my 'lil buddy!) and I gave her the balloons that somehow were still holding helium. I never saw her smile so big! I'm glad my friend stopped by with those balloons! If not I wouldn't have had a nice present for my lil buddy the next day!

RAOK received. Thanks kind stranger at the bar.,DaenerysTargaryen69,"I just fucked up, I had an important exam, I ended up going to the wrong building which led me being late to the exam and being denied entry. 
So after doing nothing for a year finally finding something I want to do, I end up fucking up. 
I went to the bar with the plan to get wasted. 
A guy walks up to me and asks me what's wrong, so I tell him, he manages to calm down. I tell him what just occurred, gets me a glass of water and tells me it will be fine and I shouldn't drink anymore alcohol. 
I was calm after that. This happens literally 5 minutes ago, I don't know who you are but thanks, I would probably have kept drinking till I couldn't anymore if it wasn't for you.",0
Almost lost my suitcase,sydneyadelle,"This happened last October. We flew United from Flint to Newark, and from there we had another flight. The plane (from Flint to Newark) was small so they were checking bags at the gate. I didn't like this at all; it was my first time flying and I had heard so many horror stories of checked bags getting lost. Anyway, when we arrived in Newark, we waited at the gate for our bags. The rest of my family had theirs but as I feared, mine never came. I talked to the man unloading the bags (I don't know his name so I'm going to refer to him as James) and he said it wasn't there, it must have gotten left behind in Flint. He told me to go to the information desk and explain what happened and they would get my bag to my destination as soon as possible. So we looked around for this information desk but didn't see it, so we decided to start heading toward our gate and from there we would figure it out. We had just hopped on the shuttle to go to another terminal when James comes running up, calling my name, because he had found my bag. He ran all the way there hoping to get to me before the shuttle left. I was so happy I could have kissed him. I wish I would have found out his name so I could write a letter or email to United to make sure he got some kind of recognition for this, but I didn't, and I've regretted it ever since. Now that I'm typing this out, I'm afraid it sounds like it's not as big of a deal as I think it is. Nevertheless, I'm grateful to him for making sure my vacation didn't start with lost luggage.

TLDR: Got on plane in Flint: Bag checked at gate. Arrived in Newark: Bag not on plane. Got on shuttle to go to other terminal for connection: Wait! Man found bag and ran to reach me in time. Me: Forever grateful.",0
Thank you to the men who help me on the road!!!,Simplicify,"This event happened on 06/11/2017. My family and some friends and I were on our way to Vegas and decided to stop at Route 66 (Bottle Tree Ranch) in California to take pictures. We parked our car on a slope and tried to drive down but our car got stuck in all the debris, rock and sand on the slope. Our car couldnt reverse or go forward . We tried pushing our car to no avail. We thought we were screwed. But then three very kind men (2 were at the place and another guy saw our situation on the road and stopped to help) helped us out the situation. The two guys helped us inspect the car and the third guy had a shovel in his car and stop on his way and offered to help us . I just wanted to so much thanks for the man for stopping out of your way to help us shovel the dirt under the car and  also thank you to two men who were at the ranch and approached us to help us out of the situation. Really thank you so much to the men who helped us push the car down afterwards. 

I dont know if these people ever use reddit or would ever read this, but I would like to say that I'm super grateful for the bottom of my heart and are super thankful.  This happened a few minutes ago and I felt like so touched and grateful I just had to write this post. Even if they dont get to read this, I just want to spread their act of kindness around. I'm so grateful and appreciative of these people who stopped out of their way to help others and would like to say thank you 1000x . ",0

An old guy who works at my local gun shop made my purchase a little better and a lot more memorable,DeltaOneFive,"So I've had some birthday money around for a while, and finally saved enough with it for a decent gun. My dad and I were headed to our local gun shop, who, among other things, sell used guns. (It should be noted here that as context I'm a minor and can't legally ""buy"" the gun, and also that my dad is a veteran. Both important for this to make sense later on). Anyways, I was deciding between two guns and my dad happened to mention that it was, in fact, my birthday money purchasing it, while the employee had out one of the guns I was deciding on for us to look at. After choosing my gun and beginning the long process of checking out and my dad completing all the necessary paperwork, I decided to wander off and look at some guns and check ammo prices. Upon returning to the counter where my dad was, the man who had been helping us said to me ""I talked to my guy in the back and knocked a little off the price, happy birthday."" I was quite obviously surprised by this and thanked him with a shocked (and happy) look on my face, and we soon headed out after. I then looked at the receipt once we were in the car and he had dropped the price by $40, excluding taxes. I mentioned that to my dad and he said that he had asked about veteran's benefits while I was off looking at other guns, and the guy had told him they don't do any benefits. So whatever the reason for dropping a $350 gun to $310, I thank you random stranger. You definitely made my purchase memorable, and employees like that definitely make me want to return for my next purchase, whatever it may be.",0

Shoutout to the strangers who helped me on the side of the road a few minutes ago!,,"So I was driving home from my boyfriend's house, and being a stupid teenager, I managed to run over a cooler in the middle of the road. I didn't know what it was at first, and I couldn't swerve out of the way because someone was in the other lane. I immediately hear a scraping sound, and drive until I find the first place to pull over that I can.
I get out and realize that it is stuck under my car. I struggle and try to pull this cooler out for about fifteen minutes, with little success. I start to get scared because I knew it would start getting dark soon, and as a young girl, I know it's unsafe for me to be out there like that at night.
I notice these people across the street come out of their house, and they shout and ask me if I need help. I immediately say yes please! They go over to me, pull out a jack and help me. After that, I was good to go.
I am SO grateful. I thanked them a bunch, but it almost didn't seem like enough! A couple of strangers saved me from being stranded on the side of the road in the dark. THANK YOU, WHOEVER Y'ALL WERE. I don't even know what to say honestly, I just thought I'd share because it restored my faith in humanity a little bit.

"Thank you, Sonic carhop.",ProPandaBear,"Today I drove to my nearest Sonic, which is only about five minutes from my house. I go there all the time and it's usually no more than a ten minute affair.

Well, this time, I pulled up nice and close to the stall so I could use my credit card without having to open my door. Now, I never turn off my car while I'm waiting for food, it never takes that long and it was cold out anyways. But, this time I remembered something my mom said about turning it off while I wait to save gas, etc. I figure why not, I can still turn the heater and radio on, so nothing to lose.

My food gets delivered and I go to turn on the car but the engine won't turn over. Great. I try about five times to no avail. I called my dad to come jump my car, but he was half an hour away. Oh well, it's cold so I'll just get ready for the wait. Buuuuut now the heat/radio won't turn on. Awesome.

So, not wanting to sit in a very cold car, I decide to see if I can get someone at Sonic to jump me. But wait, remember how I parked closer to the stall so I wouldn't have to open the door? Yep, I couldn't open the door. At least not far enough to actually get out.

Now, if I was really desperate I could have gotten out by climbing over to the passenger side, but it would have been a hassle.

Half an hour later my dad gets there, confirms I need a jump, then realizes he left the jumper cables in a different vehicle that is once again half an hour away. So he goes back.

Knowing that I'm in for another hour of waiting at least, it's starts driving me crazy. By now some of the carhops have realized I've been there a while, and my dad left my hood propped open so it was obvious I had car trouble.

Probably another half hour later one of the carhops, a guy I recognized from previous Sonic outings, came out to give me a free milkshake. Now, I know it may seem silly, but it really meant a lot to me. He really didn't have to do that and it made a sucky situation a lot better.

It just goes to show that a little bit of kindness can do a lot, so don't ever be afraid to show someone some kindness, no matter how small!",0
One of those moments,dianerama,"I had a moment today that really tested my assumptions and made me feel like a jerk and I need to share it with someone... 
I was in line for Tim Hortons and the lady in front of me was causing a scene, her coffee lid fell off as she was grabbing the cup and she lost the top inch of coffee. After getting angry and asking them to fill her cup up again she leaves. I followed her and was thinking how much of a jerk she was. Suddenly she stops at a homeless man sitting outside of the shop and gave him the coffee and a tim card. 
I was shocked at how a few minutes earlier I had thought she was such a terrible person. 
Just a reminder to myself, and anyone else that we really can't judge people so fast. ",0

Illustrator draws terminally ill kids as Superheroes,Riotgear66,"Hey Redditors. I had a cool experience that I would like to share. My wife before and while we were dating helped take care of three little boys who all had/have a disease that will end their lives before reaching 10 years old. The oldest brother has already passed away at the age of 9 and the next oldest can not get out of bed and the youngest has a permanent feeding tube. I personally had many opportunities to meet and play video games with them. Despite their condition they are always super happy and love having loved ones around.

A few weeks ago my wife mentioned to me that the two boys love superheroes and that they both had picked out super powers that they would like to have. The oldest boy wanted super strength so he could help protect other people. The youngest boy said that people don’t have super powers but that they can build cool gadgets to help. So his super powers was gadgets.

One of my close friends is an illustrator. My wife and I asked him if we could commission him to do an illustration for both these boys. He agreed to do so and refused payment. About a week later he came over to our house and showed off the illustrations. We were both blown away. He did an amazing job at drawing the boys as superheroes but also went on to make them trading cards that included a background story for each of their characters and stat sheets. He also created posters for each of the boys. He also included the videos of him drawing the characters out. He again refused payment for his work. He regretted not having enough time to do a comic for the kids as well fearing that he might not get it done before one of the boys pass away.

We will be sending the illustrations, posters, and videos to the boys this week. I am extremely grateful for these amazing people in my life. Attached are the illustrations and videos also a link to my illustrator friends site.

Anniversary Gift,Arctic_Dreams,"This is ridiculously long, I am so sorry. I have a lot to say on the subject! I was on the receiving end of a random act of kindness.

I moved across the country for college. Since the summer before I moved I have always gone to this anime convention with my (now) significant other. It is close to our anniversary, so it has become a large part of our celebration - it is the only occasion we can ever justify staying in a hotel, having a place to ourselves (rent a bedroom out of a house with some other couples our age = limited privacy). Adding on to work and school schedules giving us little time to see each other, it is nice to have four dedicated days together.

This year my SO was hospitalized, and that combined with recovery time meant a few months out of work. After that nightmare was over we started talking about the convention - because it was around the time we would usually get tickets and book a hotel. His paychecks were always much better than mine, so it was clear how much our finances had been hurt. He knows how much I look forward to this every year, but we had to be realistic and this weekend trip was definitely an unnecessary extravagance.

Fast forward a few months and they release a discount code on the convention tickets for the holidays. Our financial situation still hasn't quite recovered, but I was determined to go even if we couldn't get a hotel and make a full weekend experience out of it. However, the discount code expired a few days before my paycheck came in. I commented on a post on their Facebook group. Someone was inquiring about future discount codes and I chimed in saying I was hoping there might be another one too, and about how we celebrate our anniversary there so I was really trying to make it work. It was just me venting a little about my sadness for breaking this tradition we have had since before we were together.

I suddenly received a message request on Facebook. It was someone whose name I had seen often on the page - posting information, gathering guest requests, etc. They gifted me a pair of tickets and thanked us for attending each year, said to think of it as an anniversary gift. I had never had anything like this happen before - I was so moved. It may seem stupid, just being an anime convention and all, but it meant a lot to me that they would go out of their way to do this - getting nothing in return and even losing over a hundred dollars of profit by doing this. It meant a lot to me that we could go. With the cost of the tickets covered, which equaled roughly the cost of a night at the hotel, it made affording one for the weekend a lot more reasonable.

I don't know if they use reddit, and this wasn't something I wanted to post publicly on the convention's group page. I just wanted to share this somewhere because I could not say thank you enough to be satisfied.

Tldr; SO and I go to anime convention every year, but couldn't afford it this year. Staff member gifted us tickets as an anniversary gift.

The nurse with a good heart,Indiandane,"Hi! First time poster in this sub!
So I just remembered this and thought I'd share the good vibes.
So September before last, I went to visit an old best friend and ex of mine in psych. Hadn't seen him in a long while, and frankly I had cut contact with him, because of his drug abuse.
Anyway he contacted me again and asked me to come visit him, so I did.
Got there and was told that he'd just gone to sleep, so I couldn't go in, and I'd have to wait or come back another day.
I chose to wait, as I didn't want to take the trip again. As the hours went by, I sat and began to think about memories we had had, and I was hit with this wave of ""fuck I actually missed my best friend a lot more than I thought."" So I sat there after  10 hours and began to cry. I was tired, hadn't eaten for several hours, hadn't been talked to by anyone and I just felt down.
Then the heroine of the day tapped my shoulder and said ""Hi sweetie, I'm not supposed to do this, but here you go.""
With her she had her dinner, that she gave to me, because she'd noticed that I hadn't eaten. She then sat and talked to me and let me cry for a bit. Two hours later he woke up and we spent a few hours talking like no time had passed.
It may have been a small act of kindness to some people, but she saved my day and helped a lot. ",0
"Right place, right time",Triviajunkie95,"I run a charity thrift shop and we have a lot of regulars. Today (Christmas Eve) a guy made a $5 purchase, paid with a $20, and told me to keep the change since he appreciates what we do throughout the year. Warmed my heart! 

About an hour later a Mom with 2 kids who I know is going through a divorce stopped in for some last minute stocking stuffers for her boys. She asked if she could pay next week when she gets paid. This is a pretty common occurrence and we always try to help out when we can. (Yes, the honor system still works and we aren't in a small town). I told her she came at the right time, a guy shortly before her left enough to cover her bill. Merry Christmas!

She had tears in her eyes as she came around the counter to hug me. I love my job and the ability to pay it forward. 

Thanks to the guy who left the change, he doesn't even know he just made a better Christmas for a Mom and her boys who need some happiness this season.",0

Went to Dunkin Donuts today and it was a little bit busy...,spookification,"It was my aunt and I- we were together, but separate orders. The guy taking my aunt's order was obviously newer- He looked nervous, especially around the manager, who was a lot louder of a personality. She took my order to help the new guy """"catch up"""". After he got my aunt through, he forgot to put my order through, which caused the manager to yell at the guy.

He couldn't have been much older than 18, the minimum age to work there. He messed up a few times- Didn't refill the drinks, which isn't even his job (but his manager told him he should've), didn't put my order through. She acted like he was doing nothing right.

I'm one of those ""good"" customers, as is my aunt. As I paid for my order, I told this guy that he was completely fine- I understood that he got confused with the manager taking my order. He thought my order was with my aunt's because my aunt got confused, too.

I reminded him that it's fine- Everybody gets confused sometimes and it's kind of busy anyway. He really, really looked happy that I reminded him this. I saw that kind of rushed, panicked look on his face change to this really.. glad look. I felt so happy inside to have at least brightened somebody's day, as did my aunt, who reassured him as we were leaving that he was fine and we appreciated him.

He wished us a good day as we walked out- He made sure to shout it over to us. He deserves all of the kindness.",0
I was on the receiving end of a RAoK.,baccgirl,"For the longest time, I've been a kind spirited person. I perform random acts of kindness all the time. It may not be much, just paying for a cup of coffee, but they all add up. 
I've had quite a number of people tell me that all this good I do for others, will come back to me. I never expect anything in return, hence the reason I do random acts of kindness......then I was on the receiving end. I was made redundant a month ago, first bit of bad news. Then on Tuesday night, I found my beautiful Alexandrine parrot on the bottom of her cage unable to use her little legs. I rushed her to the vet, who xrayed and it showed a dark spot on her spine. I let some people on FB know (a bird lovers page). About an hour later, one of the admins sent me a PM to let me know a few members had come forward wanting to help with the vet bill. Very long story short, I didn't want to, but they were very insistent. The vet bill was covered within 2 days. Unfortunately I didn't have my beautiful girl for much longer. She wasn't getting any better, and I had to make the difficult decision to have her euthanised. I was completely devastated. I'd had her for 5 1/2 years. Then, during my grieving process, I only scanned some of the posts on the FB page, and I was so moved by how many people were sending good wishes and support. People I have never met! Here's me thinking the good karma was done, I was wrong. Some beautiful kind members have said they want to get something for me, and one has even offered me one of her new born baby birds (once weaned of course) for free. I don't know if it's all the good karma I've put out there, or if this world is just becoming a better place. I'm eternally grateful. ",0
I've bought 3 people meals so far this December!,RabbitFeet25,"It's a simple gesture, and one you can pick and choose depending on if you have some extra cash lying around. If you're in a drive thru, just ask how much the car behind you spent and pay for their meal if it's within your budget. If it's too much, then no harm done. But if you can pay for it, then you might make someone's day. 

I've done this 3 times this month after getting my work bonus and feeling slightly generous. I'm not wealthy at all, but I've spent around $20 and if feels great. I can usually drive away and hope I made their day better. Today the traffic was busier than normal, and the car behind me caught up and pulled up next to me at a light. The lady asked me to roll down my window and thanked me for her $4 order. It was like buying someone gold irl. 

It's not a big deal, and it doesn't really make much of a difference, but seeing someone so happy for something so small was pretty rewarding. Maybe I could have filmed it for YouTube or posted a meme on advice animals for more karma. But I wanted to share this with a smaller, more relevant community and hope it inspires some others to do the same.

Happy Holidays everyone. I've been going through some stuff recently, but there's just something about hopefully making someone else's day better that feels great.",0

"Grandma accidentally invites a stranger to Thanksgiving, says he can still come anyway",Nistlerooy18,"Here's the initial story, the follow up is linked at the bottom:

MESA, AZ - Grandmas are incredible. They're loving, and their food is amazing. So when grandma asks you over to Thanksgiving dinner, of course you say yes. But, what if sweet grandma sends the message to the wrong person? 

One Mesa woman thought she was texting her grandson and his girlfriend. She texted her grandson telling him dinner would be at her house at 3 p.m. this year. She wanted to make sure his girlfriend would also be coming. 

But on the other end of the text conversation was not the woman's grandson, but a 17-year-old senior at Desert Vista High School. 

Jamal Hinton said he was sitting in class when he got a random message in a group chat. 

He texted the woman back asking who it was, and the woman responded with: ""It's your grandma."" 

Hinton said he figured his grandmother had gotten a new number, so he asked for her picture ""just to double check."" 

And the woman responded with a picture of herself.

He then sent her a picture of himself to establish that they were not related, but figured he'd ask her if the offer for Thanksgiving dinner still stood. 

The woman, a complete stranger, said she would save a plate for him because ""that's what grandmas do....feed everyone."" 

Since then, people have gotten in touch with the woman asking her for a plate too. The woman has since changed her number, but her grandson has kept in touch with Hinton, even giving him her new number. Hinton said the grandma's family told him they'd send him the address and have a plate ready for him. 

""I thought, 'Wow, this lady is really nice,'"" he said. ""Any other person would probably blow me off, and be like, 'No, never text my number again,' but she was actually pretty nice and sweet about it."" 

He said he knows ""there really are still nice people out in the world."" 

So, next time a stranger texts you, will you respond? It could be grandma...

"Four months ago a stranger offered me support on Reddit, and it changed my life",brokenlilly,"Hey guys. 

I was thinking back and catching up with my newly made friends, and realized it has been almost four months now. So I wanted to share this. 

I lost my girlfriend to suicide earlier this year. I was a mess, in pieces and really not doing well. I contemplated suicide and had no idea of how to proceed. 

/u/erigunn responded to me [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4tbclk/girlfriend_killed_herself_a_couple_of_months_back/d5gpe44/?context=3) and offered me help, financial aid and someone to talk to. I made sure it was legit, and a bit later, I visited them. It was definitely a change in how I view life altogether. I met two of the most amazing human beings that I've ever met, and got more than I could ever have hoped for. 

The support and friendship I received from them was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes. Today I have no thoughts of suicide, I'm back at work and I in general feel much better. My life is improving and moving on, and I couldn't have done it without them. 

A true random act of kindness. They deserve all thanks they could ever get. I'm forever grateful.

So, this morning, I woke up and I was excited to see the lineup for the top 10 CNN Heroes. I was a little disappointed with the lineup but still happy for those who made it. I commented on the video.

A few hours ago, a lady castigates me for my opinion. It's disappointing because I am entitled to my own opinion. I can say and express how I feel. I don't expect you to agree but I expect you to at least respect it.

Underneath the comment is a post from a nice lady who stood up for me. I'm so touched. It's a small act of kindness that really, really touched me. Often times today, we see other people trying to hurt others/hurt others and we ,bystanders, rarely do anything about it. I believe we should stand up for ourselves and other people so that no one goes through the pain of feeling alone, hopeless or powerless.

A lady made my day at the Harrisburg Greyhound Station,isahotdogasandwich,"This happened less than an hour ago. I am a 17 year old senior in high school coming back from State College after visiting my girlfriend. the Greyhound had a connection in Harrisburg, so I got off to change busses. I tried to board the bus back to Philadelphia, but they wouldn't let me on because my name didn't match my ticket (my mom had gotten the ticket for me) and I had to pay an $18 cash fee or else I couldn't get on. I explained to the employee that I didn't $18, and he basically said ""I can try to talk to the driver, but I don't know if you can get on. Sorry.""

Then, a middle aged lady comes up from a couple people behind me in line saying ""I'll pay"" and telling me not to worry about. She told me that I was too young to be stranded as she has been in my situation before. I had $1 which I tried to give to her that she wouldn't take. I thanked her profusely and she kept telling me ""it's okay"" and ""I would never want somebody as young as you to be stranded"" in just the most genuine way. 

I really can't believe somebody could be so genuinely nice. Everybody else in line just had their head down, looking around, and this lady surged up to the front without hesitation. Thank you kind stranger. That's going to stick with me.",0
A small act of kindness that made my week,sappy16,"I arrived in Cyprus late in the evening. Got up the next day to walk to the beach. Planned to get the bus into town when I was done on the beach so stopped at a beachside cafe and ordered a drink to make sure I had change for the bus. When I came to pay I found that I hadn't switched out the GBP in my wallet for my Euros - I'd left them in my hotel room.

Asked if they took cards. Nope. Asked them to hold my drink for me while I went back to my hotel room to get money. It would have taken me 20mins but I didn't say so. They said no, don't worry it's on us. So kind of them to do for a complete stranger who'd done a dumbass thing! Of course I apologised and thanked them profusely. 

I went back the next day, bought another drink and reminded them I still owed them from the previous day. They refused to let me pay for the one I owed. I left the money in their tip jar instead. 

Thank you kind Cypriot strangers for your generosity and understanding!",0
My good deed for the day,AutumnPotter,"I was riding the citybus home from the store when I saw this poor woman trying to juggle a sleeping infant a large purse a diaper bag and the stroller, which must be folded down and out of the isle on the bus. I got off and took the stroller for her and keep it at my seat since I was sitting alone. When we got to her stop she tried to grab the stroller and everything ""I'll get it"" I told her. I carried it off the bus after I told the driver I would be right back and unfolded it she piled the purse on top the baby in the seat and the diaper bag underneath and said ""Thank you so much, once he is asleep he is asleep."" I told her I would keep my fingers crossed we both got home before the rain started. I did. I hope she did too.",0
I truly needed that.,SirGuido,"This was something that happened to me last month.  My sister got married last month and wanted me in the wedding.  Her now husband also insisted I be a part of their day.  Problem is... I'm 5' 8"" and 575 pounds.  I don't get around well.  They made it clear that they were aware of my limitations and everything would be alright.  

The night of their rehearsal was one of the most emotionally draining nights of my life.  We get there and the officiant is going over details and starts telling the groomsman what we're going to do, none of which I was physically capable of doing.  I say so and I'm told I'll be fine.  But I know I can't.  I'm lazy, I'll admit it, but I'll do anything in my power for family.  If walking the aisle and standing in front of everyone next to the two of them was within the realm of possibility you can damn well bet I'd have done it.  No matter the cost.  They wouldn't hear of it.  So instead of arguing and making a scene I just walked off to the side and had a seat.  And I broke down.  

I cried for a good 30-40 minutes.  Everyone else went inside for the dinner and I stayed there, crying.  I got inside, but by that point everyone was seated and having a good time and I looked like I'd spent 30-40 minutes crying.  My wife ignored me, and never once came to see if I was ok or responded to my texts.  

I felt isolated, ostracized, and completely alone.  So I went inside briefly to give a speech about how much I am glad my sister found her husband and how glad I am to have him as a brother, then I left.  Of course, since my ego was so bruised and my feeling so raw, I had to comfort myself.  That meant food.  

I stopped at a drive thru and ordered food.  Got up to pay and my card wouldn't process.  Didn't get declined, just wouldn't process.  She tried it on multiple machines and no dice.  Asks me if I have another form of payment, but I didn't.  I sigh, dejected, and reach over to grab the bag of food to give it back when she says ""Hold on a second.""  Then hands me my card and tells me to have a nice night.

I get home, deadening my feelings with more calories than fit people eat in a day, when it dawns on me... I check my account and sure enough.  She bought my food.  I call them up and ask to speak to her.  I asked her why she did it and she said she could tell I hadn't had a great day and she didn't want something so small to make it worse so she just took care of it.  I thanked her profusely and then cried again, but this time it was happy tears.  ",0

This guy that I have never met takes a full hour out of his day to hand carve a wooden crutch, smoothing out everything, taking measurements so it is just the right size.

Needless to say that experience certainly gave me a lot of faith in the human species.

I kept the crutch and it is currently propped up against my wall, whenever I need a bit of hope, I just have to look at that crutch and remember not everything is bad.",0
Rescued on the road in cycling accident!,Lichenic,"I guess this isn't a *random* act of kindness, but I needed somewhere to share a story of the goodness of people.

I recently rode my bike down a busy city street, and while overtaking another cyclist my wheel got caught in the tram tracks on the road (every cyclist's worst nightmare!) I was doing a decent speed and I went flying, getting lots of deep grazes.

As I dragged myself off the road, the other cyclist stopped to help me- he was a trained doctor, what were the chances! He asked if I had a rag to press on the wounds to stop the bleeding, I didn't have one though- but at that moment, a motorist pulled over and got out with a towel for me. She said I needed to have a sugary drink to help me with the mild shock, and at that moment a nearby shopkeeper came out of his cafe with a can of coke for me. They asked where I was going, turns out the motorist was going one block from there and would drop me! The doctor locked up my bike for me and they helped me into the car.

I felt so relieved and cared for, always good to be reminded of inherent goodness. Time to pay it forward hey!",0
Thanks for the cigarette on a hard morning,-sometimespizza,"I didn't want to get up early this morning, but I had a lot to do before work.

A coworker (who barely knows me) just gave me $100 towards my medical bills!,invalidusernamee,"Over the summer I contracted mono and to put a long story short, I am a little over two grand in debt from hospital bills.  Being a struggling college student with limited help from my mother, I was unsure of how I was going to be able to afford this.  I discovered that this bill could cause me to drop out of college I could not stop myself from crying.  Even after composing myself in the bathroom, it was obvious that I was still distressed.  Since I just work at the front desk, I don't have extended conversation with the people that work here.  There was one gentleman that I always had decent rapport with that noticed I was not myself.  He inquired and I was honest and told him about my bill.  He seemed to be disheartened by this news and offered me his condolences.  I didn't expect anything else and was just grateful enough to see that someone cared.  So today (Wednesday) is the first time I see him since I told him about my mini crisis (which was Friday).  Still not expecting anything, he says hi to me and asks how I am doing and I replied that I am much better than last Friday (solely because the initial shock of the situation wore off).  He proceeds to tell me that he has something for me.  He came back and handed me a check and told me that he was thinking about my situation all weekend and knows the plight of being a college student and hands me a check.  I told him that I cannot accept it but he refused.  I offered to pay him back and he just laughed and walked away.  He told me all I needed to do was write my name on it (that's how much of strangers we are, he doesn't even know my name!!!).  I opened the check (which was folded), and I couldn't believe that it was for $100!!!!  I had to go to the bathroom to allow myself to cry happy tears and call my mother.  I am just so awed right now that even in the harshest of times, there are amazing people out there that are willing to help.  I am currently thinking of ways I can thank him (besides a thank you card) so any suggestions would be much appreciated!",0

ROAK - Portland OR,gingermonkey1,"Last night a friend of a friend posted a suicide note on facebook and then turned off their phone. All their friends and acquaintances posted messages, called 911, and hit the streets looking for them.

They spent the evening wandering downtown Portland Oregon. From their facebook post this morning they spent hours in just one garage getting ready to jump. Eventually they were back on the sidewalks wandering around.  

It got cold and a stranger handed them a jacket. They said they thought about it a lot. Long story short, they are alive this morning because someone was kind and handed them a jacket.

Whoever you are-thank you. You literally saved a life last night with your act.

Freed a Raccoon For Her Baby,smokemycigwstyle,"Hoping a RAOK toward an animal is acceptable!

Setting the scene: Me, tired and worn out from a long ass shift in 30+ degrees and a not-doing-shit-air-con. I'm doing garbages around the hotel and finally loaded enough loot in my Santa sack of rotten-food and stagnant alcohol and soda goodness and sopping wet paper that can't be recycled that I'm good to make the journey to the dumpster.

Said journey is just cutting through the kitchen and poking my head out a side door that leads out to a little lean-to our dumpster and recycling/beer-bottle sorting stations reside in.

So I'm jamming along with SOAD blasting from my phone as I lug this sack of trash along in front of me. I shove an errant garbage can aside and force open the screen door and finally the heavy metal door ( \m/ ). I freeze at movement in my peripheral, my feet forcing me back as I toss the bag of trashy goodness behind me with a breath of ""Fuck!"" passing my lips. I pull the metal door shut and I wait. A couple seconds go by and I open the metal door again, wary, but ready to fight whatever manner of monster would lay before me...

Jokes, I knew exactly what it was, I just didn't know the full story.
So I open the door again and look around cautiously, drawn to movement again. I see the cage first, the live trap that the kitchen staff has taken to putting out to catch the raccoons that have been feasting on our trash from the dumpster (but anyone from out of the city knows that ""live trap"" doesn't always mean the animal stays living long). I then see the [Big Momma](http://imgur.com/gallery/c5kZJ) that was then residing within said trap. I coo and aw and look over to see a tiny bitty baby raccoon hiding in the gaps of the awning and the dumpster that had been left open by last night's kitchen staff. I'm stricken with emotion.

Mom was just trying to provide for her baby.

Immediately I set my plan in action. I knew it was going to be risky, that I could get in trouble for freeing the ""pest"", or that I could get bitten or scratched or covered in raccoon shit (she'd defecated in the corner of the trap <.< ), and honestly all of that was the last thing on my mind. I had to help her.

I knew I couldn't do very much with baby watching from the awning, he might try to hurt me or he might deek past me and escape into the kitchen through the screen door that I had shut but could not latch from the outside. It was still dark at this point, so shutting the metal door was a no go since the only light I was getting was from the kitchen (plus it'd lock me out if I did shut it). So, regrettably, I had to scare baby away a bit. I went ahead and shut the dumpster so that it wouldn't bring them back and I stepped back inside the kitchen. I slammed the metal door shut so it produced a bang loud enough to frighten baby away. Moving forward, I tried to move Momma's prison. She was heavy and I was tired, so I shuffled her cage toward the edge of the dumpster top and decided to go back and get a couple little things of hot water so I could rinse some of the shit off the dumpster.

Clearing most of the evidence of what I was going to have done, I continued on, asking God for the strength to help me complete this task of giving life to the wrongfully damned. I was tentative, Momma was confused and rightfully scared of what I was doing, sniffing at the inner hooks of the handle as it jiggled around on her side, sniffing at my hand and bracelet as I reached over her to get to the handle. I moved carefully and slowly, not wanting to startle her. I spoke soothingly as I went along, my music long muted and forgotten. I carried her cage outside, worrying a bit as I saw the sunlight. People would be waking up or coming in soon. I could get caught. I had to finish quickly and finish cleaning up both myself and the trap so that the evidence was gone and I wouldn't get sick from raccoon feces.

So shuffling along, I eventually brought her far enough away from the building that I felt comfortable she wouldn't just return to the dumpster and I fumbled with the clasp on the trap door. She seemed to know what I was doing because she came right up to the door, practically trembling with anticipation. I finally opened the damn thing and she took off, barrelling off toward the bushes to find her baby without so much as a look back.

You go Baby-Momma Raccoon. You live longer and continue providing for your baby and I'll keep trying to drill it into everyone else's heads that they wouldn't have you in the garbage dumpster if they'd just shut the damn dumpster at night and keep it clean.

Mommy's free!",0
I taught my friend how to make her favorite cake,unicorn-81,"A few years ago, my friend was telling me about how she was a terrible cook and that the cakes she made would only come out ok half of the time. 

So one day, I brought over all the supplies needed to make a pound cake, and taught her to bake one from scratch. She's made it a couple times since and I think that they've come out well. She took the cake we made home to share with her parents and they really liked it as well. When she graduated from college, I made her a cake from the same recipe and spelled out her first initial with blueberries. 

That pound cake recipe is gold, and it's nice to think that a few hours of time teaching her to bake can bring her joy and lots of good cakes for years to come. I've made the recipe with flax eggs as well, and it comes out great too if you know anyone with an egg allergy. 

The recipe I use is on allrecipes. It's called Grandmother's Pound Cake II, and it's the best pound cake recipe I've found. The crust is the best part. Golden, crunchy, sweet and delicious.

Today a man bought me yogurt,mikle78,"Today i went to the grocery store to pick up some yogurt. I was really looking forward to it because my poop was becoming excellent as I was taking the probiotic type. I've been coming across some unfortunate bowel issues as of late and was happy to learn of a great fix. As I was about to cash out and return home to enjoy my gastrointestinal glory, I realized I left my wallet in my car. I told the cashier that I'd be right back (there was none in line, it was 11pm). As I took my first step towards the exit, a man said to me ""don't worry I got it"". This man didn't look particularly well off, in fact from what he was buying and his attire, it seemed that he had his fair share of financial struggles on his own. I instantly told him it was okay and asked if he was sure. He insisted, saying ""just pass it on"". As he was African Canadian, a highly unpolitically correct version of ""my man"" came to mind, however I opted for a very sincere handshake instead. He left without looking back as I solemnly packed my three tubs of yogurt and single avocado into my bag. I saw him again on the way out and thanked him sincerely, wishing him well. Part of me wanted to give him back the $10 and I quickly rushed to my car. I then realized I actually left my wallet at home the whole time, I looked up as he drove and felt a strong urge to give back. I've never been a particularly caring person but just this one thing made me feel like doing something back for the community and pass on what generosity this man showed me and my poops.

This happened in the electronics department at work today.,Spyder465,"I want to tell you a story. 

I was at work today, and I had the opportunity to help a nice lady and her 20 year old son find an ethernet cable they needed. While we were searching for her cable, the lady noticed a boy maybe 10 or 11 years old playing on the Xbox demo in the store. The boy's mom came up to him and was ready to leave, and he looked sad because he couldn't play the game anymore. I assumed he didn't have an Xbox of his own, otherwise, he wouldn't have looked so upset to have to quit playing. The lady must have noticed the sad look on the boy's face, and she approached his mom and asked, ""Does your son want an Xbox One?"" The boy's mom looked a little baffled and said, ""Yes, but we can't afford one right now.""  The lady said, ""Well, I'd like to buy him one."" The mom's look turned to shock. She said, ""Are you serious?!"" The boy heard this, and got super excited. ""I couldn't let you do that,"" the mom said. The boy quickly interjected, ""Mom, please let her,"" and the lady said, ""Oh, it's fine. I want to buy him one."" The mom reluctantly gave in to the lady's request, and allowed this perfect stranger to purchase an Xbox One for her little boy along with a headset and one year of Xbox Live. The boy was so happy and said, ""I can't thank you enough."" The lady had a smile on her face, and her son even gave the boy his online gamertag so that they could play together. My colleague, who was working with me at the time, and I asked the lady why she did that, and she replied, ""We used to be in a bad way. Now we are in a much better place in life, and I just wanted him to have it."" We told her it was amazing what she did, and that we were glad there are still good people in this world.

I just wanted to share this story with anyone who might need a smile put on his or her face today.

Diapers,q120,"A co-worker's 18-year son's girlfriend is pregnant; his son makes just a bit over minimum wage, and she is not working. I just had my third kid this January and had a large box full of diapers my daughter has already outgrown, and I'm not having any financial trouble like they will be once their baby is born, so I decided to give the diapers to my co-worker's son. I told him to pay it forward; do something nice for somebody. I have been lucky and with my 3 kids, I've always been in pretty decent financial shape and had good health insurance. I know if I didn't have that insurance and income, I would be very thankful if somebody donated diapers to me that I would need.

Funny how even a simple gesture like giving away a box of diapers to somebody who will need it can make you feel good about yourself. ",0
"On monday, there was almost no public transportation in my city",Freyj,"Because of a strike announced at the last minute (for good reasons, though, even if I don't agree with them warning us so late), there was no bus in my town and many many people had to walk to work, and from work. (I myself walked 2 hours in the morning, and was lucky to have a friend come to pick me up in the afternoon).
Fast forward to Monday evening, I took my car to bring a friend back to her place, and when I drove back home, I saw a lady with a huge piece of luggage walking up an avenue. It was raining and I remembered there were no buses there, so I stopped by and offered her a ride to her destination (that happened to be almost on my path, so not a huge detour). She was really kind and nice and we chatted during the drive. 
It was really pleasant and I felt great afterwards. ",0
Tornado Kitty is saved (x post from Tales from the customer),mgulley08,"Back on May 9th, my mother lost her home in a tornado. Nobody but the animals were home at the time and when the fire men arrived they had found all four dogs. They were alive and well. But, her two cats were missing. We worked for hours that night looking through debris, hoping to find any salvageable moments. Finally, around midnight, we found Jace,one of her older cats.

Now we are down to finding Elby, the last missing animal. It's about 3am and my mother and I are climbing through unstable beams and broken marble and exposed wires when I hear my step father yelling, ""I've got him! Hurry! He's in bad shape!""

Elby had been inside the house at the time the tornado hit the house and took him up in with it. Elby was obviously in shock, his eyes were so swollen and packed with dirt, we weren't sure he still had his eyes. His breathing was labored. There was no question. He had to go to the ER vet ASAP. 

My husband and I load up and drive an hour into Norman and find the closest 24hr vet. The nurse rushes him in and they begin working on him. I speak with the receptionist about payment and get some arrangements made as it was obvious he would be staying overnight at the least.

The sweetest Vet comes out and explains Elby's condition. Corneal abrasions (possible lots of eyesight) and traumatic brain injury. He's in bad shape, but she feels she can get him back to mostly normal. She allows us back to snuggle him before leaving the clinic at to rest and recover. She showed us an estimate of a two day stay for our injured animal. Almost $900. We told her money isn't an object. There has been too much lost today. As long as he will recover without living a horrible life, do anything you need to do. The vet hugs us and we head to a friend's house to catch some zzz's seeing as we had driven in from East Texas. 

I call at 7:30 the next morning for an update. He's improving, but it'll take awhile and the vet's office is the best place for him to be.

Then, the incredible happened. This receptionist begins asking me about where the tornado was. Where the cat was found. Just some odd questions. Then she said, ""Don't worry about Elby. We have him and are taking care of him. Forget the cost. We are taking care of it."" Elby ended up having to stay for 4 1/2 days. The vet refused any money from my mom and step father. It was the most touching and selfless thing they could do

The cat has retained his eyesight and his motor functions are improving daily. 

These things restore my faith in love and caring for others. So thank you to all of those that help others when they are down. You have no idea how something that seems small to you can make all the difference in the world to someone else. 

The kitty is ok! https://imgur.com/xt8snRD

Thanks to the two kind ladies on our hiking trip!,joebanana,"So this happened two days ago on our trip to Vermont, on the hike up to Camel's hump (burrows trail?).  With me are my wife, my 7 year old daughter, 3 year old son and 1 year old strapped to me.  Weather forecast was great, warm and sunny.  It took us almost 3 hours to make it to 3/4 way to the top.  Was proud of everyone to make it that far.

Then BAM, naturally it starts raining and we weren't really equipped to deal with the this.  It was time to turn around, the peak would have to wait for another day.  My 3 year old's energy is mostly spent and doesn't have enough gas left to walk back down in the rain.  My wife is not too fond of the slippery rocks and mud either, the older two are starting to shiver from the wetness and cooler weather.  The baby seems to be having a blast though!  Guess it reminded him of having fun in the bathtub.  Anyway, at this point the situation is a TIFU.  So with the baby strapped to me, along with my SLR in my camera bag, I pick up my 3 year old and trek down.  It was tough with the extra 65 lbs on me and my legs getting low on energy but had no other choice.  The rain is just not letting up, in fact its coming down harder and harder.

Then these two ladies and a gentleman, also making their way down, offer their rain coat.  I refused but not too hard.  I used it to cover the two kids I am carrying.  Being much faster than us, they make it to the parking lot - trek back up with extra rain coats, and piggyback my 7 year old the rest of the way.  Wow, I have to say these two ladies really went out of their way to do something they really didn't have to.  I offer anything, cash, to repay their kindness but they refused.  I guess all I can do is send good karma their way.

Another important fact, they were Canadians from Ottawa!",0

I was pretty frustrated, and I was scowling (shitty of me I know) and an elderly lady asked me what was wrong, and if I was hurt or something. She untangled the chains (they were pretty messed up) and my bike now works fine. That was incredibly awesome of her.

Brand new teacher,ninetiesplease,"I have been student teaching (a practicum my state requires in order to be licensed) for about 4 months. I had this class and taught them for maybe a month of that time. 

Today was my last day and they all slowly walked over, presented a handmade card signed by every kid with a personal message. They slow clapped and said ""Best student teacher ever"". 

Later 3 girls walk over. Two of them ask me to sign their phone case. Lol. Another asks for a hug (another one asks as well and one for a hand bump). She puts her hand on my shoulder and says ""I cant wait until we live in a world where teachers are as open and honest and kind as you. Seriously. I hope you get hired here, I will miss you. Now I am going to cry so I am going to walk away, but thank you Ms. NinetiesPlease"". 

This fucking made my year. Teaching is so tiring, but I never really question it, even when the kids are rude. I know it is for me too and I like helping them through things. But for them to show their appreciation at this young age, where I thought kids hated teachers... and after only 4 months of being with them. i don't know if anything will ever beat that.

Something really cool just happened very quietly.,inbettywhitewetrust,"When I was younger, I never had money for book fairs at school or Scholastic book orders. I’d save all of my allowance for months to buy books from Borders. My mom also volunteered at the library and we saved books that were taken out of circulation because of a couple of ripped pages that the branch was going to throw out. Borrowing books is pretty damn great, but there’s intimacy in owning a book.
Anyway, I was on line in Target and there was a little 7-8 year old girl in front of me with her dad. She was reading a book and had another in her hand. When the cashier rang them up, her dad told her to only choose one. He asked a few times and she finally picked a romantic tween book and decided to put back a book about sea creatures. I asked them to wait and I ended up buying the second book for her. It was something so small but it made me so proud to think that maybe that girl will learn something new and incredible that blows her mind, sparks a new interest, or just makes her feel like she deserves the right to read.
I know how she feels, understanding that her family doesn’t have a disposable income for not-so-necessary things: it’s not even a matter of being told ""no;"" it’s that you know the answer is going to be ""no,"" so you never ask in the first place because you don't want to make your parents, who manage to go above and beyond and make miracles with pennies, feel like they're disappointing you. I recently graduated from NYU on full academic-based scholarship with a degree in English/Creative Writing because of tiny acts of kindness I witnessed in my youth from neighbors giving me Barnes and Noble giftcards on birthdays to friends allowing me to borrow books in school.

"My sister did the most selfless thing today, and I feel compelled to share her story.",Azmaniacle,"So I've had to work through my lunches and stay significantly late after work for 3 days now. I get out of work 45 minutes late tonight, and when I arrive at the gate to leave the parking garage, somebody is already waiting there.

 After about five minutes of waiting, I realize there is something wrong and this person must be stuck. I wait another 5 minutes and see them press the call button which I assume they had tried before already. I wait yet another 5 minutes, and decide to get out of my car and go see if this person needs some help. It turns out when he came into the garage, the terminal never dispensed him a green parking ticket. And because he didn't have an entry ticket, he couldn't put it back into the terminal to pay to leave. So I press the call button, explain the situation to the lady, and ask her to please get somebody to come down. 10 minutes, 4 cars in line, and another person approaching his car later, I decide that the poor guy has waited long enough, so I run back up to his car and insert my own green ticket and validation tickets. He asked me "" what about you?"", but I figured we had already called somebody and they would be down eventually, so I told him it would be okay.

As he was driving away, I heard him shout out the window thank you. I  shouted back ""pay it forward!"" And he said ""absolutely!""

I get back into my car and pull forward, nervous about being  the first one in line  and having people walk up to complain about how long it's taking.  But then I look on the floor of my car and see an old green ticket that I  had never had to use to leave.

 I dig around the bottom of my purse, and buy some great miracle, find two 50% off validation tickets. I insert the old green ticket for a total of $290 parking fee. And then I put in the two validation tickets I found and it covered the cost entirely. 

An initially annoying situation turned into something pretty cool :)",0
Amazing act of kindness that I had to pass along.,Epiksiko,"My wife, her two sisters and I were in a Houston's local coffee shop ""Tout Suite"" deciding what cupcakes to get,  they have killer cupcakes. Behind us was this lady holding a cup of coffee waiting to buy something else. I see her and I tell her to go ahead Ave skip us since my sisters in laws were all deciding on what to buy.  She asks me if I'm sure and i just smiled and said of ""course mam, you go ahead because we might take a while"". She thanked us and went to the cashier.  Once we got ready to pay the cashier informed us that the lady had left $20 dlls for us to get whatever we wanted.  I couldn't believe it,  neither my wife which asked her like 5 times if she was paying around. We felt super happy and humbled so we decided to do the same for the people behind us.

Helped a Canadian in London 14/04 (I think),Gogandante007,"Me and my fiancee saw a stranger in Waterloo looking very distressed, head in his hands and lent against the wall. He had crutches so we thought he might be in pain.

We spoke to him and he said he was a tourist from Canada (accent checked out) and that an ATM had eaten his bank card, he had no money and didn't know anyone so he didn't know what to do.

He looked middle aged and sounded like he was having a bit of bad luck as he had fell over and injured his leg a few days before which is why he had the crutches.

We didn't have much money on us but gave him £30 so he could stay in a hostel for the night and gave him the leftover pizza we had as we had literally just left pizza hut. I failed to eat all of a large pizza as usual.

He was really surprised and was close to tears that we helped him as everyone else just walked by and ignored him. Part of me thought it might be a scam but the fact he was Canadian makes it seem less likely I think lol and his reactioned seemed geniune.

He did go in the direction of the hostel as he got on the same train as us so seemed legit.

Hopefully he was able to get some money transferred the next day and is able to enjoy his last few days here!

Raok | Grade 10 student,Cinimode,"Mon, April 11, 2016.
This morning I was late for school because I helped a man buy his coffee. He had a bunch of loose change consisting of nickels and dimes, which definitely were not going to add up to 3$. So I bought it for him, and he thanked me and tried to give me his change which I did not accept. All I said to him after was “god bless you sir and pay the kindness forward.” Later in the day after school, I went downtown to subway to get something to eat since I didn’t have lunch. After I get my food and sit down a homeless man walks in asking to use the bathroom. The rules at this subway are that to use their washroom you first have to purchase something, so the two girls working tell the man in a very rude tone “sorry sir but you have to purchase something to use the bathroom.” Then the girl behind her says “yeah, you gotta buy something mister.” The man was polite at first and expressed that he really had to pee, asking nicely almost begging. Then the first girl starts to raise her voice and says “sir you need to leave. You can not use the bathroom unless you purchase something.” The man then starts walking away muttering about how he doesn’t want to have to pee on the street anymore almost in tears it seemed. At this point I was getting pissed, so I stand up and stop the man whispering for him to hold on. So I ask the ladies if I can use the bathroom since I made a purchase and they let me, so I give the key to the man and tell him to go use the bathroom. The girls freak out and start threatening to call the cops and yelling at me about how I can’t do that. The man uses the bathroom and after yelling at the top of their lungs they calm down, the man walks out thanks them, then me and leaves. So after he leaves I just laughed at them and said thanks for the sandwich. Random acts of kindness.",0

The Kindness of Her Heart,zylixia,"I've never posted anything in this particular subreddit before, but Reddit, I was so moved by the kindness I experienced at work today that I just needed to share.

Today, I went back into work for the first time in a week, on antibiotics that don't usually make me sick. Unfortunately, as I sat down at my desk, I realized something was wrong - I broke out into a sweat, feeling sick to my stomach and dizzy enough I thought I would pass out. So I got up and stumbled to the bathroom, thinking some cold water on my face might help me.

I walk in and start splashing water on my face. The only other person in the restroom asks me if I'm okay, and I tell her that I am, but that I'm having a bad reaction to some medication. Such a bad reaction, in fact, that I felt the sudden urge to puke, and ducked into the nearest stall to do so.

This is quite possibly one of the lowest moments in my life. I'm bent double over the toilet hoping the automatic flush doesn't go off, and that no one I know walks in. Suddenly I feel my hair being pulled back and a hand on my shoulder to steady me. This lady, who I had never met or even actually seen in my office before, actually got down on the floor with me to help me out. And then when I was finally done, she got me a water-soaked paper towel to put on my forehead and helped me lay down on the bench.

I thanked her for her help, assured her I would be okay, and then she left - only to return 5 minutes later with a cup of cold water from the fountain, to help me feel better. Then she sat next to me and kept me company for the next 10 minutes, until I finally felt less dizzy and could stand up again. She even helped me get back to my cube. As if this lady isn't enough of an angel already, she actually showed up at my cube again later in the day to check on me.

I realized by the end of the day that I don't even know her name, or what department she works in. Why does that strike me as one of the most amazing parts of this? Our company awards us bonuses based on our ""Style"", which is a measure of how kind we are to other people in the building. We need to know their name and department to report the act of kindness so they get a bonus. And unless I can track her down (I am going to try!), she won't get a bonus for that. So she really did just do it out of the kindness of her heart.

TL;DR - A complete stranger held my hair back as I puked in the office toilet, stopped by later in the day to check on me, and seems to be fine with not getting credit for it.",0

My Random Acts of Kindness Week,Connor1468,"So today I started my own personal Random Acts of Kindness week off with two acts. First, I paid for a cup of coffee then had the cashier give you to someone randomly. Second, at work tonight I paid for the meal of a Police Officer. I was nervous when I was asking them if I could pay for it, and they asked me why and that I really didn't need to, but I insisted and paid for it. My dad was a police officer, so I know they go through hard times and when he was leaving he came up to the counter with a big smile and Thanked me. I hope I made his day better in some way.

Got tickets for less than I expected; gave difference in stuff to homeless guy,sqqueen,"Yesterday I was sick and was trying to get tickets for a show coming to my area, but the online sites were all scalpers asking for easily twice the value. So I decided I was going to go downtown and get them from the box office. They were $15 cheaper than I even expected. As I passed a CVS, a homeless guy wished me Happy Birthday for no reason at all, but it WAS my birthday, so I said ""Thank you!"" I went into the CVS and bought him: 2 prs socks, one bottle OJ, one bag of nuts/m&m granola, and a pack of granola bars, plus some Reese's peanut butter cups for fun. I then went back and he wished me happy birthday again as I handed him the bag. Made me feel happy.

Also, very occasionally I can do a RAOK to family. Can't do much else right now. Do this time I want to give a great rpg to that person. But some people feel uncomfortable with any RAOK  because they dont understand pay it forward (RAOK someone else in future), and they have pride and independence and feel uncomfortable with out-of-the-blue RAOK if not in position to reciprocate... they dont understand other person's in a different place and doesnt expect anything from it... any RAOK makes them feel indebted so uncomfortable...

RAoK at the gas station,svar7alfh3im,"I ran into my sister and niece at the store today and ended up leaving my son with my sister while I left to run a few errands.  First though, I needed gas since I was on empty.  I got a few miles away and get ready to pump my gas and realize I don't have my purse!  I started to panic - did I leave it on my car roof?  did I leave it with my sister?  I didn't have enough gas to go back and search for it. I was stuck :-(  I decided to go into the station and ask if I could get $2 in gas and I would come back for it later.  The manager gave me $5 worth of gas with the promise I would be back in about an hour to pay it back.  

Imagine how stupid I felt when I got back to my car after pumping and saw my purse!  Well I went back inside and asked to pay the $5 plus put an additional $10 in my tank.  I was told I'd have to do seperate transactions, so he did the $10 first and then said not to worry about the extra $5, just have a nice day.  It was just a really nice gesture and left me feeling really nice the rest of the day.  Thank you, Drew from Speedway!",0

I get to see my parents!,Memoruiz7,"I am a medical student, in the middle of my third year of training, I have not seen my parents in two years. I saved some money and I got two red-eye tickets to come and visit me. My parents don't have the money to visit me, and no matter how proud they are of me, if I had not scrapped the money, they probably would not get to tour my school or see me during this crazy time.

In order to afford the flights, I had to shop around and the cheapest flight was from an airport that was 2 hours from where they live. On the way to the airport their car broke down. My mom called me to break the news, she was not going to be able to make it.

Then two strangers stepped up to the plate. The first one was a customer service rep that allowed my parents to switch their flight for free. I know flight companies get a ton of flack, but I want you to know, that today that rep did everything he could in his power (and I hope he doesn't get in trouble) to make this happen.

But, that still left their car stranded in the middle of the highway. 

Then a random stranger pulled over, and towed my parents car one hour back to their house. 

A random stranger! 

When my brother offered him money, he would not take it. He just said ""Hoy por ti, mañana poor mi"". I am Mexican-American, and this is a common saying in our culture. It never meant more than today.

And this is the reason why I am posting this here. I still remember this from a post on reddit. I am trying to become a physician to help, I am trying to do research to help, I go on mission trips to help. 

I promise you guys that I will never forget the generosity of these two strangers. I will never forget that there is still kindness in this world.

In short, thank you kind strangers for allowing me to see my parents again.",0
Generous strangers.,Notyoubutyou,"So today I had two random acts of kindness, first I went to the store to grab a drink, it was about 1.70, tried to pay with a 20 and they didn't have change. So the guy behind me says he will pay for it. Then tonight I went to get some food for me and my kids, as I'm ordering I realize I forgot my wallet. I tell the cashier I will be back in a few and sorry, then a guy sitting down offers to buy mine and my children's food. Completely blown away by this, the guy tells me to pay it forward, which I definitely will. Now, I believe in karma, and I always help people when I can, but I don't know what I did to deserve this. It's been a while since I've come across someone that needed anything significant, maybe a few dollars here or there, but nothing major.

Small favors can be a big deal.,reverends3rvo,"I'm on my phone so bear with me. Growing up we were poor. $6000 a year poor. Everything was from garage sales or church give aways. We renovated the shacks we lived in for cuts in rent. Slept on the floor... Blah, blah, blah. Poor me, lol. I've never had good luck with anything. Every effort I have made to make things better for myself usually comes back to bite me. I've been screwed out of college by situations out of my control every time I've tried to go. I'm very intelligent and a hard worker and have worked my way to the top in every job I've had. I ended up working myself into a position with no advancement opportunities that pays just enough that I can't afford to leave. I met a great woman and adopted our three children. Things were looking OK. Then my wife has to have a near total spinal fusion and my oldest daughter, who is autistic ends up needing several orthopedic surgeries. Three years later we are in $10000 dollars worth of credit card debt and living paycheck to paycheck. We aren't poor but are just barely getting by making minimum payments on everything. I'm never going to get back out of this hole we've fallen in. All I wanted to do was give my kids the life I never had. A father who cared and was there. A comfortable living free from being made fun of because they couldn't have the clothes or the things other kids had. A life free from being constantly told ""no, we can't afford that."" They are far from spoiled but I do my best. They understand and appreciate the value of money. They do chores and earn their keep. It kills me that we can't go out and do things together like we used to. I haven't had a vacation in 3 years. At a recent benefits meeting at work I mentioned that our in house lab work is barely covered. (I work at a hospital.) I mentioned it took half of my paycheck every 6 months. It was just before Christmas and we were scraping together what we could to give the kids the saddest excuse for a Christmas yet. Trying our best. My boss calls me into her office. I'm panicking wondering what I could have done wrong. (Nothing, of course, lol I'm awesome.) Knowing we are one missed paycheck away from being homeless, I'm sweating bullets. She tells me she could tell I had been having money troubles and wanted to help. She had several bags of small toys, games, and coats for my kids hiding behind her door. I'm not a crier. The only time I shed a tear is when I lost my dog. I teared up. I was speechless, didn't know what to say. I hugged her and thanked her. It wasn't a big deal for her. Just a few bucks and a little time but it saved our Christmas. Little things can make a big difference. Seeing them open their presents on Christmas morning was priceless.

A new's year good start,Brightt,"This new year evening, I went to an underground rave party in a tunnel underneath the highway just outside of my city. I took a lot of MDMA, resulting in loss of memory starting around 3-4 am. 

Apparently, for some reason, I decided to wandering around again (I do this a lot when I take drugs). Not only did I go wandering around, I even took the effort to unlock my bike (which was locked to a friend's bike) and left it unlocked on the ground. I vaguely remember wandering around, falling a bunch of times and being extremely cold. 

I regained lucidity while standing in some random people's backyard, moving towards their porch. It was already light out (no idea when I started my little expedition) and the woman living there saw me. She asked me what I was doing in her yard, and I explained that I had come from a party nearby and somehow ended up in her yard. I also vaguely remember saying I was very cold.

The woman took me inside as she was just preparing breakfast for her grandchildren and gave me a seat at the table. She was extremely kind and helpful to me. Her husband was obviously a bit more skeptical about my presence in their house, to which I take no offense. Must be weird to come downstairs on New Year' morning and find a doped up young guy full of mud and small injuries in your porch.

One of the grandchildren (he was around 10-11 I think) asked me how I got in their yard, and I said I didn't remember (I really didn't). He looked puzzled and asked his grandmother how it's possible that I don't remember something that obviously happened only a few minutes earlier. The grandmother smiled and whispered *""d, r, u, g, s""*. I tried to apologize, but she smiled and said *""don't worry about it, I was young once too""*.

After breakfast, she was so kind to bring me back to my dorm by car. I apologized for being in such an inappropriate state in front of the children, but she said not to worry about it. That it was a good way of learning something about the world for them.

I didn't exactly remember where their house was, so after I got some sleep I went out to try to use my google skills to find their address so I could send them a thank you card. I tried google maps and found a bunch of yards that could have been theirs, but I recognized their porch and found the address. After some more googling skills I confirmed it was their house and went out to get a card.

For those interested, here is what I wrote on the card:

*""I send you this card because I wanted to thank you again for your good care and hospitality this Friday morning. I still don't really know how I ended up in your yard, but I am very glad it was yours. It must have been a strange sight to see a blurry young man full of mud strolling through your yard.*

*I might not remember how I got there, but I do remember being very cold. Luckily I didn't fall asleep somewhere in the woods, or this story could have had a much less happy ending.*

*I also have to admit that this is certainly not the first time I have a strange adventure when I decide to go wandering during a party. But I have to admit that this is definitely one of my favorite adventures so far. It's people like you that give color to life. I've been aided on my adventures (be it after an evening out or on one of my travels) many times by random people and it warms my heart every time. Next time I help out a stranger and he/she wants to thank me, I'll tell them that I owe the universe one.*

*I hope that I didn't paint a bad picture in front of the kids. I tried my best not to look and sound too drugged, but I know that doesn't always go as smoothly as one would want.*

*I wish you the best and I hope that in a time of need, you too will be helped by a good soul that happens to cross your paths.*

*Eternal thanks,*

******* *""*

A little thing today that made my day. Goes to show how a good heart and kindness will come back to you.,iliketoworkhard,"Was roaming around in a town in California, came across a tiny local pizzeria. Was hungry, so I went in.

There was just a single old man inside, who walked with a limp. He welcomed me warmly. Business was slow, it was cold and pouring outside. I was probably the only customer for the past and next hour. I asked him for a pizza by the slice, he started making a fresh pizza for me. Gave him a $5 note, he went in and came back with $2. I took it back without much thought, but when he went back to work on the pizza, it occurred to me that I should probably tip this old hard-working man.

Now I'm someone who's cautious with my money, not for stingy reasons but because I like to donate to a lot of wildlife and cat causes, and I also volunteer a lot, and I'd rather spend my money there.

Anyway, so I'm battling a dilemma over a dollar. I eventually make up my mind and decide that I'll give him a dollar, a little can go a long way for people in need. Also, I have an uncle with polio who's limped all his life, and worked hard for success in life. I'll just resist the temptation for halls from the gas station next time. Need to cut down on that anyway. He gladly accepts and I leave with my pizza.

Well I go out and lo and behold, the box had 2 slices! The man had given me an extra one out of the kindness of his heart. I don't know if the sight of me being cold and drenched made him, or if he just does it to anyone asking for a slice. and man was it good pizza?! Holy shit it melted in my mouth.

Day 7 and 8 of #kristas30to30 happened today (wasn't feeling so good yesterday). My mom and I were shopping at Walmart and the cashier happened to mention it was her birthday tomorrow. Bingo! Found my first target. We went to the Tim Hortons and bought 2 $5 tims cards. I wrote a little note in her card and went back and gave it to her. The look of shock and not knowing what is going on always makes me chuckle.  
  
As we continued our day, I was keeping an eye out for someone else who looked like they needed a pick me up. I didn't have any success. Maybe it's all that Christmas music playing that had people in good spirits? So I decided when I was leaving Zehrs I'd put it in the windshield of the car next to me. I really hope it made them feel special too!

My mom started doing this YEARS and YEARS ago. Simply just buying the coffee for the person behind you in the drive thru. My favorite part is trying to get away before they can catch up to you. We always felt like it was a high speed chase when I was younger lol  
  
I also attempted a bonus act of kindness today when I saw a couple having some care issues. I went and asked them if they needed any help or a tow truck. I offered up the use of my CAA. Thankfully, they had CAA and a tow truck was already on the way. It is the thought that counts :)  
  
**Day 10**-12/11/15  
Day 10 of #kristas30to30 happened in Waterloo at the eye clinic. There is meter parking there, so I thought it would be nice to pay for the next persons parking! Of course as I was taping it to the meter my mom drives off on me.... thanks mom LOL  
  
I also got a little bonus action in when some friends asked me to let out their most adorable puppy. But really....it is a puppy!!

**UPDATE 1**  
  
**Day 11 & 12**-12/12/15 & 12/13/15  
Day 11 and 12 of #kristas30to30 are both a little sweet. For Day 11, while grocery shopping I added a toberlone bar to our bill and gave it to the young man cashing us out as we were leaving. This guy had such a look of shock followed by a big smile and then said ""Really?!, you just made my day!"" My BF noticed how much enthusiasm he had for the next customer. I have to admit, his big smile had me smiling all the way home. 

For Day 12, we grabbed some lunch at Subway. The people who work there are always really friendly (like most ppl in My small town), so I thought a box of turtles for them to share was well deserved. She was another one who didn't really seem to understand that there was no catch, no one expecting anything in return, it was a just because gift. She was really thankful and I'm sure it will help get her through the dinner rush :)

**Day 13 & 14**-12/14/15 & 12/15/15  
On Day 13 of #kristas30to30 I decided to buy the woman's drink behind me at Starbucks. Turns out she wasn't feeling so good and she said it put a smile on her face. Her only complaint....I wasn't ahead of her at the LCBO(liquor store) haha...she was funny, I liked her. 

On Day 14, I was actually able to surprise my mom by dropping off some [goodies](http://imgur.com/CuxVMsy) for her and her colleagues at a meeting they were having in town. It doesn't happen often that I'm able to surprise her since she is usually on the other side :)  
  
**Day 15**-12/16/15  
Day 15 of #kristas30to30 had me so excited! I feel like My best friend, Dan pulled a random act of kindness on me. I get an email saying that he had sent me money. Wait? He doesn't owe me anything! I open the email and it's $50 to fund today's act of kindness!! The wheels started turning and the scheming began!

I recently saw a video of a ""Santa"" buying people's purchases at the Goodwill...he spent about $1600! It inspired me to get a [$50 gift card](http://imgur.com/UCXLwUd) at Tim Hortons and pay for as many people as I could. It was so inspiring! So many thank you's, questions why, and genuine smiles. After one guy discovered what was going on he was inspired to add another $20 gift card to my cause! Another lady said she had a ""Scotiabank your movie is on us"" moment :) 

With the funds I was able to pay for 12 people's coffee and lunches! I know this impacted the people who had their orders paid for and all the staff working there. Truly an awesome experience, I'm on cloud 9 right now.

Small but big for me.,Dlanly,I work as a house keeper at a hotel in my town. I've been feeling down lately and was not looking forward to work at all this morning. After I got my rooms I did the normal and knocked on all the doors all were empty but one. I was not very happy about that. I didn't want to spend more time at work waiting for people to leave. As I was walking down the hall I walked by the room that was occupied and a women came out and stopped me. I was in a bad mood and annoyed and didn't feel like talking to people. But she thanked me for all the hard work I was doing and complemented me and gave me a ten dollar tip. Her kindness hit me hard I've been happy all day since. It wasn't even the money that made me happy. Words mean more than any amount of money. ,0
The stranger that taught me to be kinder,,"I've been relatively poor for the majority of my life. I grew up in a dirt road a block from the slums in Brazil and money was tight. When I moved to the US to come to elementary school it was like a whole new world opened up, but I soon learned it wasn't all it cracked up to be. I was still poor and this time it was much harder to afford a lifestyle equal to all the other kids. This went well into my high school years, where I worked two jobs but still wore clothing from 8th grade into my junior year because I couldn't afford to go shopping every year like the other kids.  


In junior year I decided to join the yearbook club to help out since I had been doing graphic design since I was a little kid on our family computer. I spent a good portion of time where I wasn't studying or working at the kitchen actually designing the layout and gathering the content for the yearbook (since I was one 3 yearbook members).



By Senior year, orders were supposed to be fulfilled, and I learned that the senior yearbook would cost about a weeks paycheck. I resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn't be able to pay for senior portraits and kind of forgot about it until the day everyone got their books handed out to them. I was surprised to find myself pretty jealous, on top of knowing I wouldn't afford college I was missing out on another experience all of my friends took for granted. Imagine my surprise when I was called into a classroom to receive a package from an anonymous staff member who bought the book for me. I never asked for it nor made anyone aware of my economic situation, but that little act of gratitude made me break down. 



They didn't know that that little act would make such a huge difference in my life. With that, I learned that my design abilities we're worth developing and I started doing side graphic design work immediately after graduating. Once all my friends went off to college, I got two internships, then was hired a year after. It's been 4 years now and I have a solid career making a good amount of money that allows me to support my parents and donate a sizeable amount every year to the causes that I choose. Every year I make a point to help as many people as I can because I know how small acts of kindness (coupled with hard work) can make such a huge  impact on people's lives. 



Never underestimate how much the $20 that may barely get you a pizza may help the homeless man on that corner, or how easily offering to help with your elderly neighbor's chores can relieve them of pain (emotional and physical) and making yourself available to help people (including strangers online) can save a life. Next time you ask yourself whether it's worth your time/energy/money to help someone, do it anyways, because you'll be a happier, healthier person in the long run. A stranger taught me that a few years ago and I'll never forget that. 


TL;DR - An anonymous teacher helped me buy a yearbook I designed and couldn't afford, which led to a chain of events that set off my career and now allows me to return the favor to others. ",0
Haven't experienced any in a while. Looking to spread some myself.,,"My life has been down and out pretty bad as of late. I haven't seen or experienced kindness in the past month (except my loving husband) but I'm someone that craves and needs it. Kindness. Humanity.

Teaching my children the meaning of Christmas!,b1naryst0rm,"I am working with my kids this year to teach them the true meaning of Christmas. Since we don't have much to spend this year, we are doing what we can and also raising money to perform acts of generosity and kindness.

Something as small as finding a folder could change their day.,Kavex,Ok this is a story of someone did for me tonight. This person may not know it but they brought tears of joy to my face. I'll give you a bit of context so you understand how important this was to me. I am transgender and have been transitioning for a few years now. I store all my paperwork in a black folder to keep it safe and only pull it out when I need it. I needed to get a new ID from the DMV so I strapped it to my bike and went and got my new driver licence. (Place was only like two miles so I biked there) Well on the way back I lost the folder and spent hours looking for it. I finally gave up and went home. I was really depressed and mad myself for losing this folder because it had basically my last few years in it. Well two days later I get this text someone an unknown number. I don't know how they got my number but when I read the text I nearly jumped out of my seat. This person was so kind to put my folder somewhere safe so I could retrieve it. They have truly saved me.

Customers come together to help pay for prescription for US military veteran diagnosed with cancer,missiongirl42,"I work in a top retail pharmacy chain in the US. In the midst of our crazy busy day, a lady approached me and explained that there was a lady outside asking other customers for money to pay for her husband's prescription. Before she even finished her first sentence I had picked up the phone to call a manager. The lady stopped me and said that she wanted to contribute, but she couldn't afford the entire amount. I reluctantly put the phone down and continued to listen. The lady asked if she could write a check for $30 and leave it with me for the prescription. She then described the customer's appearance and quietly left the store. I was close behind, looking for the lady. I found her in the parking lot explaining her situation to another customer. As I approached the two ladies, the customer began to cry and apologize for haggling our customers. I stopped her mid-sentence and told her that another customer was contributing $30 toward her husband's mediciation. She then began to cry some more, but this time they were tears of joy. She then explained to the customer we were standing with and me that she was still short $15. As I racked my brain to see if I could spare $15, the other customer handed me her debit card and said, ""Go. I'll be in in a few minutes."" The lady and I then quickly walked back to the pharmacy as she was explaining that her husband was a veteran was diagnosed with cancer, and did not have health insurance. I asked his name and pulled up his prescription on the register. I ran the $30 check, then the $48 in cash that the customer had, and was running the other customer's debit card for the remainder as she walked up. Before I know it, the lady is asking for cash back in the amount of $40. After the transaction she grabs a candy bar and gets another $40 in cash back. As I'm handing her the cash she grabs yet another candy bar and gets another $40 in cash back. I handed her the total $120 and she immediately handed it to the lady who was sobbing at this point. The two customers hugged, the lady asked me for a hug, and then asked to hug my co-worker. I then resumed my duties, but not without reflecting on the interaction.
This interaction was completely sobering for me. At first I was quick to judge and slow to listen, instinctively contacting my manager to ""deal"" with the woman who was asking for money. Then I was trying to see if I could spare $15 rather than selflessly giving as God has called us to do. While I am disappointed in my thoughts and actions, I am so glad to know that there are others who are willing to step up and make a difference, especially when I fall short.",0

A couple of butterfingers candies. Broke my heart. He kept going in and out of subway, I think in hope that the employees would offer him a sandwich.

It hurt to see him peeling apart the sandwich and eat it, so I left. Hope he enjoyed it.

RAOK Birthday Fun!,amblynn,"It was my husband's birthday and I was trying to do something a bit nontraditional. He generally buys himself anything he needs and I couldn't think of a good gift for him.


After watching a video from www.thebdayproject.com I decided to surprise him with a ""scavenger hunt"" kind of RAOK day. 
 [Here](http://imgur.com/a/PK5tK) is a quick summary of our day from Imgur.



So...the answer to your (probable) question is, YES, I had my husband doing things for other people on his **own** birthday. But just because he didn't get a tangible ""gift"" doesn't mean that he didn't enjoy himself. He made other people happy by doing the simplest of things. This was a very memorable birthday, and one that I hope can inspire others to follow suit.

Halloween and Anorexia- Stranger Support,RavenOmg,"Happy Halloween, my fellow redditors. Today, was pretty shitty. For me, anyway. I was so excited to go out with my favorite girlfriends, all dressed up and everything. An hour before trick or treating I got major anxiety. I suffer from Anorexa Nervosa, so all the candy and chocolate and crap are not my friend. I told them I wouldn't go because I'd binge and lose all control, but we compromised. I'd go, but not get candy. So we're going, and a majority of the houses were asking why I wasn't trick or treating, & I was just saying ""Domt feel like it"" and stuff. Super awkward. One lady even said she was very impressed by my self control ... Anyway we came to one house, and a energetic middle aged man said to me, ""Hey, where's your trick or treating bag?""
Timidly, I replied ""I don't have one ..."" And he says, ""Hang on a sec!"" And he disappears briefly, and returns with a small, purple bag. My heart melted right there and then. While he didn't know I'm suffering from an ED (hence why I wasn't toting) he honestly made me feel so supported. I did trick or treat after that for a bit, and it's not a big thing he did, but I really, really appreciate it. It's the simple things in life we need appreciate. I don't even know the man, too. Oh gosh my whole heart melted through my chest.

What can I do to help someone out directly?,24WheatBiscuits,"I feel as if I need to do my part to help out the people who live around me.

I know giving to charity is a great way to help, but I feel as if I would like to do something directly. I'm in the process of establishing my own business, and I plan on hiring those who are living on the streets in order to get them back on their feet. But I'd like to do something in the meantime.

I noticed there was a subreddit where people could request loans and pay back more afterwards. I was thinking of giving someone a loan, but with a catch - I wouldn't want anything back, they can keep it.

I know it feels great to help people out, but I'm wondering if you guys can give me some inspiration :P",0

Just a RAoK story to brighten your day.,LittleBit8,"Last weekend as my daughter and I were out and about, we stopped for fuel and noticed a Hispanic family standing by the road holding a sign that said they were hungry, and had no place to go. There were 4 of them: what appeared to be Mom, Dad, and two young sons. I have a bad habit of using my debit card for everything and didn't have any cash on me, so I asked my daughter if she had a few dollars in her purse that she could spare. She asked why and I told her I just felt like we should help that family. She hadn't noticed them so she turned around in her seat to look back at them. She reached in her purse and pulled out all of her cash and said, ""I'm going to give them all of it!"" I told her she didn't have to give them all of her money, that others would surely help them too and every little bit adds up. She told me she really wanted to give them all her money, so I didn't argue. We pulled up next to them and as she reached her every dollar to the mother, I started to cry like a baby. The mother barely spoke any English, but I did hear her say thank you with tears in her eyes. She will never know that my sweet, kind hearted, selfless, 10 year old is likely the reason she fed her family for a few days at least. I still cry when I think about it. ",0
My almost random act of kindness!,Fuel-For-Life,"My friend told me I should post this here, so here it is! 

I was housesitting for my sister and I went to buy food at the local grocery store. When I arrived there was an old woman sitting outside on a blanket. Needless to say, I felt bad for her. Even if it was (And it most likely was) a hoax, some sit there with a hidden iPhone between their blankets to call for a ride home when it's late. Anyway, back to the story. 

So, I felt bad and I thought to myself that I should buy her something to eat instead of giving her money. So I walk into the store, start buying everything I need and then I pass a small salad bar they have there. I took some chicken, pasta, lettuce and all that stuff, closed the lid, went to the cash register and paid for my stuff. Once I got out I looked to my left to give her the food and voilá! She was gone... to be fair it was 7pm and it was getting dark. So I walked home, put the salad cup in the fridge and thought, ""I'll just give it to her tomorrow"".

Well, the next day at around 12.30 pm I walked back to the store with the salad in hand and a smile on my face as I was hoping I was going to make this old lady's day. I arrive and she's not there... I walk around until 1 pm and then decide to go to a resting place and eat it (I ate it because I was going to enter the store, I can't enter the store with a salad I bought there and I couldn't just leave it out on the street). I ate it, threw the trash, went in to the store, payed for my stuff, left the store and voilá! There she was! But I already ate the salad...

**TL;DR:** Bought salad for homeless lady, she wasn't there when I got out, waited until the next day, she didn't show up so I ate it. Went inside the store, got out and she was there.",0

First I need to clarify that my name here is true I am a big OLD momma ,hence the reason myback gave out....

Hey ya'll Yesterday out of the blue something told me to stop at a local grocery store which is out of the way and something I don't normally do .. but oh heavens did we hit the motherload . One of their meat frigs failed so they were tossing four dumpsters worth of ribs,chops,steaks,chickens etc. I was flabergasted and did my best to load the car( usually I go with my daughter but this was a spur of the moment stop while I was alone in town ) came home after talking with workers there who explained why the meat was there, made sure with checking recalls . then filled our freezer and deep freeze. Found out one of our neighbors was out of food and filled their freezer, our sons, and took boxes overflowing to an adopted son and his wife to fill their freezer and his mother's .... I just wish I could have found a sweet local diver who I met once and helped him .. We did return and filled more boxes and took it to an area food bank who's jaws dropped with racks of ribs etc. I just wish I could have colected it all and given it all away but the over five grand I recovered wasn't even five percent of what all was there, but my back gave out on me .",0

"By request, things I've figured out with my Homeless Care Backpack thing.",bubonis,"By request, /u/SmokedSlabs, updated content and strategies that I've learned in the past year and a half of making and handing out Homeless Care Backpacks.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/21vmet/the_20_backpack_project_our_first_assembly/

40th Backpack: https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/3a2h83/delivered_our_40th_homeless_care_backpack_today/

First, backpack stuff...

I stopped buying packs at consignment shops and such as the supply and quality is never consistent. I've also been told that those backpacks are harder to live with on the streets as they're bulky even when they're empty, so they're hard to move around with and conceal when not in use. About a year ago I started buying drawstring backpacks in quantity (15-20 at a time) off ebay; I get them for $5 apiece which is the same I was spending at the consignment stores. The nylon bags are sturdy enough to carry a full load, and when they're empty they can be folded up and put in a pocket.

I stopped putting non-essentials in the bags; candy, pencils, pens, lighter, note pad, etc. The few dollars I save there are better applied to other areas. It was also pointed out to me that things like napkins and plasticware aren't necessary as they can pick up that kind of stuff pretty much anywhere.

Don't cheap out on toilet paper. While a roll of single-ply Scott will be appreciated, a role of quality two-ply paper is OH SO MUCH MORE appreciated. Seriously. Toilet paper should be put in a ziploc bag, too.

I made some changes to the toiletry set. I no longer include mouthwash as the cost-to-benefit ratio just wasn't there. And instead of spending $1.33 on a bottle of shampoo AND a bar of soap, I instead spend $1 on a LARGE bottle of ""3 in 1"" body wash/shampoo/conditioner, so cost goes down and usefulness goes up. I also traded off the pack of 10 antibacterial wipes for a package of 40 ""regular"" wet wipes as the additional quantity was more important than the antibacterial part.

I also no longer buy first aid kits; I make my own by buying large quantities of the supplies and bagging them up in small ziploc bags. Each kit has four alcohol wipes, two large band-aids, two medium band-aids, four aspirin tablets, four acetaminophen tablets, and a homemade straw-tube of antibiotic ointment. Total cost for each kit is something like 36¢ I think.

I still buy much of my supplies from the local Dollar Tree, but I've also been buying supplies at a local flea market (Englishtown Flea Market in NJ) where I can often get all of the food I'm looking for at half the cost. There's a few sellers I've found who sell food in damaged boxes — the food is fine, just the box is fucked. So I'll get six granola bars, or a HUGE box of saltine crackers, for 50¢ (instead of a dollar). I can also get bottled water there for about a dime apiece, compared to about 16¢ apiece at the Dollar Tree. So when I go to Englishtown I'll stock up on all this stuff and parcel it out as needed, bringing my net total down.

Through all of this I've been able to keep my backpacks at a pretty consistent $18 apiece or so, while simultaneously increasing the amount of food and useful goods inside of them.

Now, other stuff I've learned...

* While the homeless I've encountered appreciate the bags, they're more appreciative of the time I spend with them. Even stopping for ten minutes to talk to them as an equal is SO very appreciated. Listening is even more important than talking; nobody pays any attention to a homeless person so listening to what they have to say makes them feel better as a person and is invaluable.

* Almost none of the homeless people I've encountered will ask for more than what you're giving them. I've probably handed out about 50-60 packs and I think two people have asked me for something (money) in addition to the pack. I typically get a thank-you, and occasionally a tear will be shed.

* I've met some AMAZING people on the street with all kinds of stories from all walks of life. The stereotypical homeless person is almost always fiction.

* I try to take note of the person's situation and see if there's anything else I can do. I ALWAYS ask about their job skills, in case I'm able to help them get a job. Sometimes I'll notice something less obvious, like missing shoelaces (common) or a broken belt, and if I can I'll see about replacing or repairing them as appropriate.

* Virtually everyone seems to believe that if you're sitting with a homeless person, you must be homeless as well. I've had lunch many times with some of the homeless people I've helped and I can't tell you how many times people have thought I was homeless as well. I don't take this as an insult; I just find it fascinating that this assumption is so automatic.

* The general public gives the homeless a HUGE hard time. They're insulted and put down ALL THE TIME. They're accused of EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME. They're hassled by building managers ALL THE TIME. It's insanely stressful. One of the more interesting things I've noticed is that the police generally won't hassle a homeless person if an ""obvious non-homeless person"" is with them. A few times I shared a pizza to a couple of homeless people while I was dressed in business casual, and I saw police walk by and do nothing — yet minutes after I leave the cops get in their faces, sometimes very abusively so. This fascinated me almost as much as it disgusted me.

* A handshake or a hug will make both of you feel good.

Co-worker moved my deadline after finding out I was in trouble,Altaccounthere,"In a state of semi panic and fear after leaving my physically abusive ex boyfriend, I sent an email to my workplace secretary asking her to please not give out my new address to anyone and to alert me if anyone comes asking. In doing so I admitted to her my situation. I didn't expect anything but cursory professionalism as we don't really know each other very well, and I don't think I've ever done anything to deserve more. If anything, I've been an administrative headache.  


This morning, I got a short email from her reassuring me that my new address is confidential. A bit later I got another announcing that my super important job evaluation deadline has been moved from next week to next month ""due to unforeseen circumstances"". I've just put two and two together now and realized that the unforeseen circumstance was my personal troubles. I'd never asked her to, and she never claimed credit, but I suspect she  moved it to help me out, and she did so completely discreetly and out of her own initiative as well; she schedules all meetings. I'm really touched and I cannot thank her enough. Bless her.  ",0

""Excuse me, do you mind if I pay for you?"" 
He seemed very confused. 
""... no ...""
So I added my order and paid the total. The man stood there confused for a couple of seconds, coffee in hand, before saying ""thanks.."" and so I bid him a good day and he left.

Thinking back on this, I realize I could have executed the deed better, letting him know it's just a spontaneous act of kindness so he wasn't as confused as he was, but hey!- there's a first for everything, right! I felt great after doing that and I look forward to doing it again. ",0

As you can see from the picture, they noticed my top open and ran out to cover my entire open car with plastic sheeting -- including taping it down.  

When I returned and saw the ground was soaked I realized that I'd made a mistake and figured my car would be soaked to the bone with an inch of water on the floor.   But instead I discovered this awesomeness and when I removed it there wasn't even a drop of water anyplace inside.

I eventually figured out who the people were that helped me out and thanked them profusely.  I was so impressed with their quick thinking - they grabbed a big piece of plastic and cut it with scissors to fit and then taped it together all while it was starting to rain!

TL;DR  Left my car's top down during a thunderstorm and someone covered it with a plastic tarp and taped it down.

Kindness is so important.,desireeray,"I really want to share this story! It was a small RaoK but it meant so much to my mom! It feels good to write about it because I haven't shared it with others besides family!

I sat down on the stoop to what had been my mom and mine's apartment for most of my youth. I sat there sweaty, tired, and mentally drained. My aunt had been staring at me for a few minutes and encouraged me to go to the store to grab some water. We finally  finished the biggest stretch of what had been an exceptionally hot, emotional, and labor intensive week. 

My mom had died four days prior. I had to choose to take her off of life support after her painful year-long spiral with pain pills, alcohol, and anorexia. My step dad passed away just two months earlier after giving in to a pain pill dependence that had succumbed into a heroine addiction. I was an only child that had to go figure out what to do with an apartment full of 16 years of stuff and a mild case of hoarding. 

Water sounded perfect. I walked to the corner store and was greeted by a stare from a presumptuous cashier who I didn't recognize. It had been eight years since I had stepped foot into that store and I swear nothing had moved. Old outdated hamburger helper boxes and cat food stared back at me from the shelves. 

I grabbed my water and proceeded to checkout. The cashier was just as friendly as she looked -- a furrowed brow, frown, and raw way of speaking. 

Curiosity got the best of me, and I asked her if she knew my mom. At first she was extremely defensive and without wasting a second shot back, ""No."" Then out of no where, her face lit up. It was as if I was speaking to an entirely different person. She begged me to stay for five more minutes until she had her smoke break. She had something that she desperately wanted to share with me. 

Of course I obliged and waited patiently outside for her to finish up ringing out the customers behind me. The minute the they left she came flying out of the store with her cigarette and lighter in hand. She grabbed a ""Be back in 15"" sign and locked the door.

She started to tear up and told me that she did indeed know my mom. She introduced herself as Carol and told me that my mom had changed her life. 

Apparently my mom was a regular at the store that came in every single day to buy some cat food and a pack of cigarettes. (My mom had three cats.) 

Carol had worked at the store for almost three years and explained that she had seen my mom almost every single day at the store. Every time my mom came in she would greet Carol loudly and with a huge smile. Every day Carol would get grumpy and annoyed and try to move my mom along as quickly as possible. Carol was all about sticking to business, and my mom was just another annoying regular. It was also a somewhat bad neighborhood, so keeping conversation to a minimum and coming off a certain way isn't a bad idea.

Carol told me that one day my mom came in, and she wasn't smiling anymore -- in fact -- she didn't even say hi. Carol was taken aback. She was used to my moms bubbly demeanor and unique smile. She asked my mom, ""What's with you?"" My mom just said she was tired and had a long day. Carol stopped her and said, ""No, No, you're not getting away with that excuse, what's going on?"" 

My mom explained that her husband had just died a few days prior and she just felt exhausted. This crushed Carol. 

In her words, ""Every single day your mom would come in, and say hi. She made sure she knew my name from day 1 and I just acted like my regular busy self. Even annoyed sometimes, I'm all about my business, I don't have time to talk, but this took me back. Wake up and smell the flowers people, be kind! You don't know what others are going through!""
That night Carol went and wrote a Facebook post about her moving experience and it got well over 100 likes and over fifty people commented about praying for my mom. 

The next time my mom came in, Carol shared what she had done on Facebook with my mom. My mom broke down and started crying. She said that no one had ever done anything that nice for her before. Carol said at this point she was crying too. From there on out she was always happy when my mom came and greeted her at the store.

She said she never woke up and faced the world the same way again. Whenever it was possible -- she would be kind. 

She thanked me again and again for hearing her story. She said that she thought someone from my moms family should know. 

I was crying of course and thinking about my mom and I's turbulent relationship, but realized -- The only thing I could do was be kind, and remember my mom on days when kindness feels tough. 

TLDR; Cashier was moved by my moms recent loss and made a vow to be more kind to strangers!

Random Acts of Kindness suggestions for elementary school club?,anonymeee,"I am putting together a “Kind Kid’s Club” to hold once a week at my elementary school in the fall. I am looking for suggested random acts of kindness activities to fit into my daily lesson plan structure below:


* 5-10 min. **Icebreaker** (Example: “Hello popcorn” where students introduce themselves by sharing one thing they like about themselves, and one thing they like about another person in the classroom)

* 5-10 min. **Recollection** Students share their experience with last week’s homework assignment and any random acts of kindness they have received or given this past week.

* 30 min. **Activity** (Example: Writing a letter to a soldier, create/decorate a composting bin for the school, writing positive encouraging notes to hide around the school, etc.)

* 5 min. **“Homework” and goodbye**: Simple assignment to keep in mind over the following week (Example: Help parents with a chore tonight, try to be extra nice to your sibling or friend this week, etc.)


Restrictions:

* The acts must be accomplished with the allotted timeframe above.

* Activities must not require expensive materials to complete. (I am a teacher, so most of the budget will be coming straight from my wallet.)

* The activities must be accessible to students of all ages and abilities. (I work at a school for students with learning disabilities/differences, so students have attentional, behavioural, cognitive, and academic delays.)

This is my robin.,bubonis,"http://i.imgur.com/KSKexPa.jpg

You have no reason to believe any of this so if you want to downvote and call fake then go for it.

**TL;DR: Rescued a robin while mowing the lawn, now I think he's following me around when I mow the lawn.**

About two months ago while mowing the lawn I discovered a fledgling robin flapping around in my back yard. I stopped the mower so I could move him out of the way but he immediately took off running/flopping right towards my compost pile. Before I knew it he scrambled over the compost pile, fell down the 12'-ish slope, and was splashing about in 4-6"" of water in the storm drain at the bottom.

I climbed down and, holding on to a sapling for support, and scooped him out of the water. I climbed back up and brought him into the shed where I wrapped him up in some clean(ish) shop towels. I brought him back outside and held him in the sunlight for about a half hour while he warmed up. When he started chirping and fighting to get free, I moved away from the compost pile, set him down in the grass, and walked away. About two minutes later a couple of adult robins landed near him and after a few minutes the three of them made their way into the forest. I finished up my lawn mowing and went about my business.

About a month ago I was mowing the lawn again and I noticed I was being followed. A robin was following me and my mower, about 5' behind me and 2' off to the side. When I reached the end of my line and turned around, he would fly around and land behind me again. He would do this for awhile, then fly away, then come back a little while later and repeat. He never comes closer than about 2-3' away from me but he's clearly unafraid of coming even that close to me. Every time I mow the lawn he reappears again.

I'm probably reading a lot more into this but, eh, whatever. It makes me feel better and isn't hurting anyone or anything. I don't know that it's the robin that I rescued. I don't even know that it's the same robin every time. But I like to think that it is, that he remembers me, and this is just his way of saying ""hi, I'm still alive, thanks for the save"".",0

Free things for uni students,Lichenic,"It's the first week of semester 2 for me this week, and on Thursday I met a new friend who turned out to share 2 of my subjects.

Old man randomly gifts deaf baby girl (unknowingly) a baby sign language book on our walk,moldypeaches12,"Something seriously so awesome happened to me today, I can’t help but share it. 

(keeping everything as short n’ sweet and confidential as possible)

I am a nanny to a very special baby girl with chromosomal syndrome called Wolf-Hirshhorn. It is a syndrome that affects many parts of her body and mind. One of those parts is her ears. She is moderately deaf with the hearing loss in both ears. She has hearing aids and we work with a Audiologist/Speech Pathologist weekly, and just learned our first couple baby signs (Mommy, Daddy, Nanny)

Today we had Music Together class, as we do every Tuesday, then I usually take her on a 45 minute walk around the park. On our walk today, she fell asleep so I covered the stroller so the sun wouldn’t get in her eyes. On our way around, I noticed an older man (probably upper 70’s) made eye contact and started walking towards us. Honestly, I wasn’t sure what he was gunna go on about (where I live, there’s a lot of crazies that like to talk) and being with the baby, I always try to be more aware of my surroundings. 

This man came up to me, wearing a satchel and floppy hat. He asked how old the baby was, and her name. He actually seemed like a sweet old man, so I introduced myself too. Then, what he proceeded to do literally melted my heart. He pulled out a childrens book from his satchel and told me it was his last one and he wanted me to have it. The book was titled “My First Signs”, and it is an introductory baby sign language book, absolutely free of charge and completely from the heart. 

I instantly lit up. I told him how kind and generous that was of him and how useful this book will be considering baby is hard of hearing, and he said he was too! I told him about us working on our first couple signs and how excited our speech pathologist will be when she hears about this. He was so happy to give this book to us, and he told us how special we are. After I asked his name, I couldn’t help myself but to give this guy a huge hug, and told him how much he made our day. 


This random act of kindness inspired me. It has inspired me to pass this kindness on, in hopes of it continuing to get passed on. And there are people in this world that truly care, and want to make the world a better place. And I saw that today, and I will never forget it. 

Here is a link to the letter I found inside the book when we got home.

As I prepare myself for the awkwardness of asking to borrow from a stranger, or making do with toilet paper (ick!), I notice a little clear plastic baggie taped to the wall, with a little label ""For emergencies, help yourself! :) "". Inside, half a dozen pads and tampons, some toilet paper, a little pack of soft tissues and a wet wipe. Basically everything you could possibly need in case of a bathroom-related emergency. I later checked the other stalls, and they all had identical baggies; some more extensive, with little bottles of hand sanitizer also.

Thanks so much to you, kind stranger, you really helped me out, along with, I'm sure, a bunch of other women. My favourite underwear emerged unscathed, and I avoided the awkward toilet paper improv-pad, for which I am eternally grateful!

Strangers who helped me last night at the San Francisco airport around 9 p.m.,dekanerab,"To the couple who helped me last night at the San Francisco airport around 9 p.m. when I became stranded overnight due to a delayed United flight - Thank You. I’m not sure where you came from, but you were the ones with wings last night.

You may never see this, but after the experience I had traveling over the last 27 hours I am determined to focus on the kindness you showed me.

My flight from Houston to San Francisco was delayed 1 hour and 15 minutes due to a shortage of bagging staff in Houston. While on route to SFO to catch my connecting flight home the flight attendant told me, via the Captain, that I should let the United customer service rep (and I use this term loosely) know this was due to the shortage of staff or they may not find me a hotel. When I arrived in SF I ran for the gate and my heart dropped - all my hopes dashed - I had missed my flight. I spoke to the United customer service who rebooked my flight on the first available flight out -- 8 a.m. the next morning. After she was done she started at me waiting for me to leave. I timidly asked “Well, what do I do for tonight?”, to which she informed me they would not be helping me with a hotel or food because it was not United’s fault. They blamed it solely on other issues (which conveniently they do not cover). I explained what the Captain and flight attendant had told me, but she told me there was nothing she could do and offered a supervisor.

I was in a foreign country I was not supposed to be in as I was only in transit through the US. Thus I had no US currency and was stranded with, no money, no where to stay, and nothing to eat. I was freezing and ill prepared with only clothing suitable for hot weather with me. As I waited for the supervisor (who also ended up doing nothing and told me “We’re not going to doing anything for you” just as you had said) I was so stressed, tired, and shocked I called my husband and began sobbing and asking him what I should do.

You must have been similarly delayed, waiting at the desk behind me while I spoke to the first agent, then watched me sit on the ground and break down. You gently came over to me and said “hello” and I embarrassedly paused my phone call. You asked if I needed somewhere to stay, and if I could get back to the airport in the morning. I nodded though a world of blurred glassy softness. You handed me money and said it was for my hotel. I was so embarrassed for crying, and so distressed all I could do was shake my head in a weak no. You softly told me it was OK and not to worry as you’d just been really lucky in Vegas ( I’m not sure if you just said that to get me to take it -- but I shakily extended my hand and watched as you pushed the money into my hands). You told me to take care, and your partner told me “Don’t worry it will be OK sweetie” - my world got fuzzier and I’m not even sure I said “Thank You” - Thank You. It was such an amazing act of kindness I’m still stunned it happened.

When a company who recorded a profit of $1.97 Billion in 2014, is not willing to do anything, but a couple I have never met went out of their way to help a stranger -- that’s amazing, and that’s what I want to focus on.

Your money got me a hotel and breakfast in the morning. Your kindness went the miles that United couldn't fly me that night. I have $80USD left which I want to match and pay your kindness forward. I’d like to donate it somewhere that helps travelers in need - any suggestions?

I am so sorry if I couldn't manage to say it last night, but Thank You",0

""Last question, how do I cook them?""

Without hesitation I told the cashier to just add her total to my own, after all it was the least I could do for the okra lesson. The older woman put her hand on my own and with cheer only equatable to winning the lottery she told me that she could now afford to buy her son a birthday card!
A woman behind us in line was happy to hear this older woman's joy and gave her a crisp $10...

I did my first RAOK today!,ceilingfanofdoom,"After months of lurking, I'm joining in on the fun. Should have started ASAP. 

So I'm (16F) in tenth grade in the U.S., and my school ends Wednesday. Me (and the other 1,450 kids in my high school) have had finals since Friday. Feeling shitty, I wrote 6 letters of encouragement and placed (hid) them in the bathrooms near the vending machines. Each letter had three one-dollar bills in it. I instructed the recipient to buy three sodas. Here were the rules. Keep one to drink, give one to someone you appreciate, and give the last to a total stranger. I also included my phone number, but not my name. 
Hopefully someone's day was made by the addition of a soda. I hope someone knows they're appreciated.
Eighteen people should be filled with fizzy sugary drinks at some point thanks to me. I hope they get as much joy in their treat as I do.

Me and my boyfriend have been struggling a lot lately and some random lady just gave us $100...,,"Me and my boyfriend have been doing terrible lately. We're living out of a nasty, dirty motel in a really bad part of town. We don't have a fridge or anything in here, it's so hot and infested with roaches.

We have to catch 3 buses to get across town to our minimum wage jobs that barely pay our weekly rent at the motel. It is a 2~ hour ride one way depending on if the buses break down, or people want to get in fights on the bus. (Some guys got in a fist fight once, we had to pullover, call the police and medics an wait for a new bus. I was an hour late to work!)

The buses pass us often too, also causing us to be late to work. We both had to ride our bikes 24~ miles back home last night because the last bus left the station 5 minutes early! (We ALWAYS bring our bikes with us for this reason!) It's supposed to leave at 7:20 according to the bus guide, we rolled up at 7:14 and saw the bus pulling out of the station. Shit sucks.

We have to bike 2 miles down the road to use the laundromat, and the machines barely work. They always eat our money and it's $4.25 to run the washing machine!!! We spend over $10 sometimes on one load of laundry (plus drying it, etc.)

I guess some lady had seen us struggling around town. She came up to us at the laundromat while we were waiting for our stuff to dry and handed us 5 $20's! We couldn't believe it, said she had been trying to find us somewhere. Said we were some of the most hard-working people she'd seen and that we always looked really happy and in love. My boyfriend gave her a huge hug and he looked like he was about to cry.

Just the fact that she noticed us was like so flattering, we try so hard to stay really positive and always smile despite how hard everything is for us. We were also $120 short of paying or weekly rent of $290 and she saved our asses and gave us another reason to keep on smiling. :D",0
Returning shopping carts,sqqueen,"If there was such a thing as a *petty* random act of kindness, I suppose this would be it.

Prom Girl in the Blue Dress,karma227,"So, I've never posted to this subreddit before, I've never even lurked on this page at all, but after what I witnessed last night during my shift at Petro-Canada (its a gas station chain here in Canada) I had to find somewhere to tell the story! As I mentioned before, I work at a Petro-Canada in London, Ontario and Friday nights are the bane of my existence there. People are leaving for trips so the gas bar is consistently packed and because there is not one but two major Lotto draws in the next 48 hours, I get slammed with everyone wanting to get their tickets as well. As you can imagine with all this business and only one GSA to work the station, things get backed up, people get angry, and my Friday nights always get ruined. It just so happens that around this time of year, the High Schools in the area start to hold their proms, so yesterday I happened to serve a HELL of a lot of people dressed to the nines, either going to or coming from their Prom. Towards the end of my shift a van load of girls in ball gowns shows up to get some gas. Since it was already passed 10pm the station had been quieted down to a dull roar of customers. At the same time that one of the girls wearing a blue dress starts to fill up, a middle aged guy in dirty sweat pants, stained shirt and rusted, 20+ year car also pulls up to the pump and starts filling up. Both the girl and this man finish at the same time and come into the station together. As they approached the man held the door open for the girl and went off to the bathroom as the girl in the blue dress came up to pay. As I was processing her transactions she leaned forward and whispered to me that she also wanted to pay for the mans gas as well. I asked if she knew him, she put on a big smile and said, ""Not one bit,"" then proceeded to pay for both tanks of gas. She said nothing else and left as soon as she had her receipt. She was getting in the van with the other girls when the man came up to pay and I told him, ""Sir, your gas has be covered by the lovely ladies in that Van there."" He was speechless for a beat then the look of utter happiness came on his face as he tried to stumble though words to say that he had only ever heard of this sorta thing happening in web posts and articles in magazines, I have to say I agree. When he left he seemed like he was on the verge of tears. So if your out there and reading this, prom girl in the blue dress, just know that your random gesture of human caring and kindness not only made, what appeared to me, a massive impact on that man, but also instantly made my day one that I won't soon forget.

**TLDR** A girl in a blue prom dress paid for a down-on-his-luck mans gas as well as her own and left before she could see how thankful he was and before I could tell her how awesome she is.",0
"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but my friend is trying to do a good thing. And I'm just trying to help him. (x-post from /r/outdoors)",wheelotime42,"A friend of mine recently went hiking, and was disappointed to find trash on the trail. And so he did something about it. I know not all of us go hiking or camping every day, (I certainly know I don't), but the next time I do, I'm going to do the same thing he did. If we all do a lil something when we have the opportunity, maybe we can make a difference. Just like your elementary teachers said. :) Here's his caption to his facebook photo:

Here's a real challenge for all my outdoorsy friends. Anyone who likes to hike, fish, swim, walk, or just be outside. I challenge anyone and everyone to bring a plastic bag the next time they are in the wilderness AND then pick up any trash you see. This bag of trash was from Glen Onoko falls in Jim Thorpe. I'll do this every time I go out hiking now, and you all best believe I'll be trekking out with 2-3 bags like this every time...I shall call it, The Clean the Outdoors Challenge!.....c'mon ppl share this and participate with me to take the trash out of the woods and back in the trash cans!

The first lesson after graduation.,,"I was coming home from graduation and asked my mom to stop at Taco Bell (brcause I was hungry and tired). When walked up to the car, my mom saw that driver wheel was flat...We then drove to a close McDonalds parking lot (since it was well lit, and there was a ton of people). My mom, in tears, as we had to drive to the new apartment early next morning to meet with the Air Conditioner repair men. The drive to our new apartment is 2 hours and no way we could make that car drive as we have to fix the car first thing tomorrow morning. We called AAA (car insurance) they instructed a road assistant to be at our location within 2 hours. In the meantime I'm texting my uncle (my auntie and uncle were down for the graduation). While we were waiting, this random stranger asked if he can help. And this guy changed our tire to the spare. 

I feel very grateful for a stranger to help my mother and I, since we do not have the skill or strength to remove a car wheel. From his dress I assume he works with cars or machinery. I learned that if one person has a skill he/she should always look to apply that skill and to benefit the world around them. I just realized that my education and experience was not in order to receive a diploma, high test scores, or acceptance to a great college, but to really benefit society through both small and large acts of kindness. I always had a goal of impacting the world, and would always look at things at a macro scale, but now I feel grateful and now appreciate the micro and individual acts of helping. 

TLDR: I finally understand the reason for education after graduation when someone helped me with a flat tire.

Small RAOK that made someone happy...,Seetherrr,"Sometimes the smallest act of kindness goes a long way. I was in line at the local convenience store picking up some candy because my gf and I had a craving for some candy. The person in front of me in line was an older guy, probably in his late 40's early 50's dressed in relatively cheap blue collar clothes. He counted out a dollar in change to put a dollar of gas in his car. I got just under $5 in change and had the cashier put the gas on his pump. When I let him know he was extremely thankful. It wasn't a huge gesture but it was well worth it and I hope he pays it forward at some point if he is in a better situation. I know that letting people know about your generosity takes away from one of the most important aspects of giving but I thought that sharing this little act of kindness may encourage someone else to do something similar. In Las Vegas there are many people asking for money on the street but I feel like those people tend to be the least likely to spend the money wisely. Finding someone who looks like they work hard but aren't doing well financially are the best people to help. I hope I brightened his day a bit and restored a bit of his faith in humanity.

If you are in a position to help someone like this, I really recommend it. A small amount of money and empathy can go a long way and finding someone too proud to ask for help are the best people to help. Keep your eye out and try to help those who are struggling but working hard in the daily grind we call life.",0
Returned a generic mobile and got a lot of thanks in return,rdx711,"Few years back I was travelling back home from office when at the station I saw something that looked like a mobile cover. Then I realized it was actually a mobile. It was a low end mobile which must have cost around INR 5000. I took it home that night. Next day called the number with the contact 'Home'. Their maid picked up and said they had someone in the hospital and had gone there. Later I received a call back, met up with that person and returned the phone. He was a professional who had already lost 2 expensive phones so he did not buy an expensive one this time. He said the contacts were more valuable than the phone. We talked about what we do and luckily we were in the same profession, only I was studying to become a professional. He asked my office address and we parted.

Returned a high end mobile phone I found.,rdx711,"Few years back I was walking on the road while coming home when I saw something that looked like a mobile phone.

I looked around and saw a taxi stopped in the middle of the road with the passenger door open and a guy frantically looking for something in the taxi.

I walked up to him (hiding the phone behind me) and asked: What was the matter. He : I lost my phone and can't find it. I : Which phone was it. He : Blackberry XXXX I (showing the phone) : Was it this? He : Yes

I gave him the phone and he left without even saying thanks. I thought maybe he was in a hurry to reach somewhere.

I was able to brighten my neighbor's childrens' day with a small gift,alc5092,"I live in a duplex that is inches away from an identical duplex.  My neighbors live in the other duplex, so two doors down.  They're Hispanic and I'm not sure how well they speak English, other than the 'hellos' we've exchanged in passing.  I've seen a lot of people in and out of the apartment, so I imagine that they struggle with money.  They're hard working - I've seen the men come home many days from work (maybe landscaping or construction?) looking exhausted.  My roommate moved in January and randomly left a Dora the Explorer Scrabble game.  I looked inside, and the board was intact, but I didn't know if all the pieces were there.  I'm currently physically limited and don't drive, so I hadn't been able to drop it at Children's Hospital or a library or something.  I saw my neighbors and a few of their children outside today, and offered them the game, explaining in the best way I could that my roommate had left it, and wondered if their kids wanted it.  They exchanged words in Spanish and then accepted the game and said thank you.  The kids immediately opened the game and their parents started helping them play.  Even though it was used, they were very excited for something new to them.  I've been struggling with a lot of depression lately, and being able to do that small act and seeing the kids happy gave me a little joy.  =)  ",0

Unexpected inheritance,mtbrider,"So lately I've been struggling. I was in college, but am dropping out because I have the credits required for policing now, and just want to move on to real life.

A big reason for this is my relationship. Me and my girlfriend have dated for two years, and every summer and winter break is spent away from each other, and we hate it, it sucks.

A few weeks ago I decided to propose, I've known I wanted to marry her since a ,month into our relationship, but I only had 100 dollars to my name(due to stupid spending). We had been planning on moving in together this summer, but I decided to see about getting an engagement ring financed(even though I want to avoid credit of any kind for now) so that I could get her the ring she deserves, but I was so stressed and nervous that I wouldnt be able to move in with her while I paid for the ring.

Then my grandma calls me and asks me to comeover. She has had her grandmothers ring, and she never told me, because she wanted to make sure I was serious about the girl, and it looked like I would do whatever it took to get her a ring, and she didnt want me proposing too soon because I had a cheap ring. 

My grandmother just helped prevent another year of misery, and depression, giving away her favorite thing from her grandmother to me. I can't thank her enough for that.

Unfortunately all the servicing it needs and resizing will come to around 760.00 so I might still have to put off moving in... but I'm so glad for the help she gave me.",0

Some good people saw Age of Ultron today,cosmitz,"So i thought i'd never get to post anything else that's worth it [after last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/31hpka/youre_safe_random_taxi_girl/), but apparently life has a new-found knack for putting me in that position.

1st of May, national holiday, and me and two of my friends decided to go see the new Avengers: Age of Ultron at a nearby mall. 

I had just gotten off my tram and was waiting at the stop sign at a very busy multi-way, intersection. I was just noticing the that movie was starting in 30-odd minutes when a car sped past on the lane nearest to me, one that had a green signal light to turn left. The next thing i saw, a dude not older then me, twenty-something, as he was running to cross the street was struck by the front of the car, crashed on the windshield and then dropped down hard on the concrete. 

It took a moment for my brain to register then ran over to him as everyone stared in shock. Be that time he had gotten himself upright but he was bleeding heavily from a large gash on his forehead. The woman driving the car got out and clearly she couldn't process what happened and started harassing him as to why he ran across the street, all while he was bleeding out of his head on the pavement. I was trying to gouge if he was really fine as i was getting him out of the street to somewhere to sit down. Pulled out a napkin to put pressure on the wound, half to keep the wound closed but more to keep him calm. Blood in his eyes would have not helped him relax and cope.

At this point i turned around to ask someone to call the emergency number and i remembered how amazing people my friends are. 

They had just gotten out of the tram, presumably the same one the dude was trying to catch. One of them saw me attending to him and was already on the phone, calling and asking for the police and the ambulance while the other was calming down the woman which apparently also had three small children in the back of the car.

Seeing that taken care of, i started calming down the dude and kept him talking as he was in shock and i was afraid he'd pass out. He was asking questions like 'what was the number of that car', whether his laptop in his bag was fine and if he bloodied himself. Tried to keep the mood light and him content with answers like 'nothing that won't wash out' and just calling out the license plate (with me remembering it in case she does run off) but also started to ask and look for bigger issues than a bloody forehead. 

Don't get me wrong, i'm not a doctor, but i do take a first aid course that i refresh each year and i do dabble a lot in situations where knowing stuff like that will come in handy. I asked him if anything else hurt or if he felt warm or wet anywhere else. As expected, aside from the gash on the front, he had a very large bump on his head that i felt while holding his head back, and thus a possible concussion. Luckily everything else seemed fine. He wasn't grasping at other body parts, was making sense while talking and did not feel any pain as i was palpating his chest to check for broken ribs.

By this point the woman had gotten her car off the road and was visibly panicked, bypassed my friend and started taking our phone numbers. You find a lot about a person when you put them under pressure, and this woman wasn't a very good person. She mentioned how ""her evening was ruined"", how it was ""his fault"" and even that ""her children will be scarred"". The dude wasn't in a state to start arguing with her and was saying how 'the other cars had stopped'. Indeed, he was in the wrong here, but that /really/ wasn't the time to start casting blame. I asked her to return to her car and see to the children, and soon after we saw the ambulance pull up.

The EMT asked what happened while taking a look at his bleeding head, and i supplied just the basics, car crash, gash, large bump on his head, possible concussion. I noticed he brushed me off past 'car crash', and i can't say i blame him or hold it against him, a lot of 'do good citizens' don't know the first thing about that sort of thing and are usually more in shock than the person with the wounds.

The dude called an acquaintance and told her at what hospital he'd be in and then was taken in the ambulance by the EMT. At this point me and my friends provided testimonies for the cops that just arrived, while the lady driver asked us 'not to lie about it', like we'd cast the blame on her intentionally or something. Either way, we were given leave by the police officer after writing down our details. 

As i was wiping my hands of the last remnants of wet blood one of my friends checked the time. Apparently we'd also get to be in time to see some fictional heroes do good things as well.

"Ok, this is a small and maybe a mildly OCD thing to do, but I love trees. Like I love trees quite a lot.",mtlchk,"I always have my cloth bags packed into my big girl's armbag (you know the type. It has almost everything including squirrel food, in my personal case).

So whenever I get on the metro and see the mangled newspapers about to get dirty enough to no longer be recyclable, I pick them up and put them in the bags, then take them to the bins. I also do this when recycling day was a windy day, and I salvage the paper that has not yet gotten too dirty and wet and then find it a home in a recycling bin. 

Sometimes I'll pick up random fresh receipts and bank statements that people leave on the floor because they don't care to select the option to view their balance on screen. I don't make a big point of it because that would kind of drive me nuts. I do most of what I see as I am walking, and so it's not a big deal. But what if everyone or just a substantial minority of everyone was a recycling fairy like me? Better, right?

I love trees. I don't know how many trees my paper shuffling has actually saved over the years, but probably a few. Woooo Trees!

I have a particular hatred for those plastic six pack holders. They are like torture devices for marine animals. We send them across the sea in barges, and they inevitably get out, floating all tempting and shiny right on top of the water. The clever animals go for them. I hate them and resent stopping my bike to pick them up, feeling angry as I do. When the weather gets warm I see so many of them, and the ""Ah, Goddamnit, fucking people"" mantra gets going in my head over it.

But I just thought today, hey, I probably just saved a seabird, or maybe even a supercurious baby dolphin from being cripple by one of these hideous devices and left to slowly die of starvation and sepsis. I mean, I do this ridicuous stuff for just that reason. Don't get angry, K, think about the life they get because you took five seconds out of your day to collect it, cut it up so it doesn't catch anywhere on their curious, pokey noses or investigating appendages and then pack it to be properly recycled.

That's like an RAOK religious observance, for me. Almost no one looks at me funny, and I think most are impressed when they see the method to my madness. If we all did that with random trash, especially the sort that hurts such as plastic circular thingies and discarded hair elastics then we'd save a lot of beautiful animals. It's happened somewhere, probably, already, because of me. A gorgeous animal is now alive that wouldn't otherwise be because of me. We'll never meet, but we're connected. So that is how it becomes a spiritual observance, too.

Simple, nice thing to do. Make it into a spiritual/religious observance, if you are able to see it that way. Don't go along with the crowd for the sake of it because they have no reason for what they do, just that it's what you do. Be conscious of the world around you, instead. My tiny act has great benefit in the world far from me. I am connected to that animal, to those trees.

That's a pretty cool thing, so nuff said :)",0
A strange encounter on the street,Nerrolken,"I got a haircut this morning.  When I left, an old, gray-haired Indian man with a big bushy beard locked his eyes on me from almost a block away.  Laser-focused.  Not threatening, not angry, just intently and intensely looking.  Regarding me.  Almost like he was trying to figure me out.

He was between me and my car, so I started walking toward him.  I looked back, though not with the intensity that he was sending straight at me.  I smiled at him.  No reaction.  I nodded at some passersby as I walked, checked the time on my phone.  It takes a while to walk a city block, when you're aware that you're being watched.  

All the while, he stared at me.  Blank expression, nothing on his face except for a searching, evaluating look in his eye.

When I got a building or two away, I nodded at him. It seemed like a polite way to acknowledge his presence.  He said nothing, made no move.  Just watched me.

Finally, my car in sight, I passed right in front of him.  He turned his head to follow me, looking me right in the eye.  When I was directly in front of him, not three feet away, he finally spoke.

""You are a lucky man,"" he said.  ""You know why.""

With that, he turned and walked away.  He never hesitated, never looked back.  I didn't respond to him, although I did stop and watch him leave for a few moments.  Then I got into my car, and he disappeared around the corner.

To be honest, I don't know what just happened.  Or even, really, what he meant.  But I haven't stopped thinking about that encounter all afternoon, and the more I think about it, the more I think, 

""You know what?  He's right.""",0

It took a lot of work, but after reporting to the SPCA and working with the landlord over there, she is safe and sound at the SPCA. Those rotten people will get criminal charges of animal cruelty, too.

And well, tomorrow I am going to sign up for the foster program at the SPCA. Maybe I'll even get to foster that sweet, little puppy. My 15 year old dog just died, recently, and she would be welcome here.

Funny how things happen. Providence, I guess. It was a minor bureaucratic nightmare to get her out, and I had to put up with great piles of shit from the neighbours, too, but it's a really good thing to know she's going to be ok.

"I made a website for a stranger on the opposite side of the world, who I met randomly on an app, for free.",,"A couple of months ago, I was using an app which lets you send messages to random people. I met someone in Australia and we had a little chat, some banter, and generally got on quite well. In less than a day, I found out that they ran a rental cabin. The website was dated.. like from the 90's.. but they had received quotes of thousands of dollars for a new one.

Being a web application developer, I decided I'd offer to create it for free. I guess it was a combination of realising I'd met someone wonderful who genuinely would benefit from my help, and having some spare time on my hands.

A Guest At The Hotel I Work At,BennyTheBomb,"I'd like to tell you about a guest that stays quite frequently at the hotel I work at. He has been staying with us for about 12 years now. Our hotel is near a major Boeing operation so we have alot of clientele from them, with many guests returning many times of the year.

For the past two years, in addition to our Christmas bonuses, the General Manager has come to us all (in housekeeping and laundry, and I can only assume front desk and maintenance as well at a later time) and given us all envelopes. They were from the guest I mentioned that stays often and each one contained a $100 bill and a very nice Thank You letter on Christmas stationary.

I figure between all the employees it had to have been somewhere between $2000-$3000 that he gave us each of the past two years. Often times our guests leave the room a mess or do not think to tip (even at the holidays) and it is very heartwarming to think someone would care that much about random hotel staff. ",0
One simple act of Kindness,,"Today I (34/f), along with my best friend (who happens to be my ex-boyfriend as well) (33/m) /u/dfuzion helped a young girl who is homeless. While he was at a gas station, she asked him for change. Unfortunately, he had no change to give but instead took her to the grocery store to purchase food for her. Being homeless (together) just a few short months ago he knew that even the simplest act of kindness from a stranger makes a huge difference. He brought her over to my home, knowing that while I do not have much, I am always willing to help someone in need, just as he does. In talking with her I felt an instant connection with her, I discovered she is related to my step-family  who I am estranged from. I was able to give her a little money, blankets, pillows, food for her dog, a flea pill for her dog(my dog passed away last month and happened to be the same weight range as hers), a prepaid minute phone I no longer need and most importantly, an open heart and someone to tell her everything will be okay. By the grace of God and help from strangers we were able to get off the streets so we will continue to pay it forward just as others did for us. ",0
Listened to someone who needed it.,csrgamer,"I work at a frozen yogurt shop, and there is a man who used to frequently hang around in the mornings (11:00 or so) with a beer in a paper bag.  He was always a little tipsy and never seemed all that happy.  One time before opening the shop, I walked over to him and asked him how he was doing.  I ended up sitting on a bench next to him listening to his story.  When he finished he had a few tears rolling down his cheek, and began apologizing, and thanking me profusely. He immediately walked straight to the trash can and threw away his half full drink.  He told me he was going to fix his life, and I haven't seen him since (it's been about a month).  While I didn't really do anything to help him, I think sometimes just having someone who cares to connect to can make a world of difference.  Hope you're doing all right wherever you are!

It happened awhile ago but maybe someone wants to hear something good! :),,"I am currently 22, graduated from college and working. I like to do nice things for people because obviously, I like it when nice things happen to me. I have a story to share that happened when I was 17, working at a fast food restaurant and looking for any excuse not to work. I lived in a tourist area in Florida and we have patrons called ""snowbirds"", or older visitors who come when it is cold weather and then leave when it is hot. When I worked at my first job (a fast food chain), the snowbirds would come in every day for their VERY specific meal, some conversation, and then leave. There was this one man who I always ended up talking to. He was very nice, very kind, but usually kept to himself. He would stick a dollar in my pocket after I refused to take it (company policy). One day, after delivering his food, I sat down and began the usual daily chatter. After talking about our days, I pulled a out Valentine I made for him. I can't even remember what it said, I just remember I spent a considerable amount of time glueing paper doilies and cards together. He suddenly began to tear up and brought up his wife, whom he had never mentioned. She had recently passed on and he was having trouble dealing with her loss. He told me how much our morning talks meant to him and how he wished we could have a romantic dinner together (always breakfast talks and I was underaged greatly). I remember laughing it off and enjoying my conversation with him. Every Valentine's day I think of this old stranger whose name I don't remember and I have no idea if he is still with us. I don't know if anyone will even read this, but the smallest gesture can make our lives. Do something nice for someone today. :)",0
You're safe random taxi girl,cosmitz,"So this just happened.

I was leaving a club with some friends and we called three cabs. In one of the cabs there was supposed to be me and another friend. Me going to B, him to A.

Insert random girl here which apparently had more then enough to drink and was trying to hold it together. It wasn't clear then, but she was out of battery for her phone thus the problem with her calling a taxi. So she asked us if anyone's going around C. Seeing how after leaving me off to B, there was a straight line to her place in the C area, we said sure, why not.

A little into the trip she told me that apparently her friend bailed on her and she was on her own and that's when she realised she might not have enough money, and seeing as the taxis don't take credit cards.. i just said not to worry about it. Again, she was rather seriously inebriated, and i couldn't really trust her to know her address by how she was talking(note, she only mentioned the area, not the exact adress) and before we could get anything more out of her, she fell asleep on the back seat... so at that point i said to myself 'fuck it, i'll take her to her place and then swing all the way back to get home myself'.

My friend got off first and then i got to see my place swing out of view as we drifted into the night to her apparent place. When we reached the general area i asked the taxi driver to pull over so i could wake her. Smart move, as only a few phrases in the jumble of talk she commenced puking.With the speed of a flying leopard in dragon stance i opened the door, afterwhich she turned over and started puking outside the car.

So here i was, holding the hair of a girl i didn't even know her name, hearing and watching her puke for a good five minutes and handing her tissues.

When she was done and upright again, we managed to get a bit more info out of her, luckily, seeing as her phone was dead, a fact we realised now, and we couldn't call anyone to confirm an address.

The taxi ride to the new destination would have even been romantic if she'd have been my girlfriend... sun rising from the horizon, her holding her head on my chest, and me trying to act as a human suspension to keep her comfortable and her head level. As much for her benefit as for the benefit of my new jacket which i fucking love to bits and it would have been a shame to have her commence a second barf-a-thon on it given the new setup.

So we finally reached the destination, and again, she was rather scared of her situation, and really didn't want me to walk her home. Still, i was satisfied when she appeared more sober and pointed to an apartment block and felt confident of her choice. We exchanged pleasantries, and first names and we went our separate ways. Even so, i waited in the taxi until i saw her enter the building as the good upstanding human being that i apparently am.

The taxi driver, as confused as anyone might have been asked me after all this on the way home: 'so, she wasn't your girlfriend?'. 

So dear Madalina, i hope you got safe to your bed.

~Signed, a dude that just wished to get you home safe.

PS: Dat taxi bill though.

I made a new friend today in a little town up north.,hoboBusker,"i was travelling through a little town in northern ontario, having a bit of a rough time, down on my luck. i was busking outside of a mall when a guy walked passed and nodded at me as he went into the mall. I nodded back not thinking anything of it. 15 minutes later, having finished his shopping, he returned with 2 cups of coffee and cookies. We chatted about travelling, and music, we bonded over punk rock and how it all gets away on you. After he left I found a 20 dollar bill tucked away in the cookie bag. He gave me his facebook and the next time I come through we'll definitely have a few beers and jam. It changes my whole perspective on life these little tihngs. Talk to strangers kids!",0

[Weekly Random Acts of Kindness Discussion] Share your stories!,imnotlegolas,"So I figured to try a hand at perhaps a weekly discussion topic, where we can share random acts of kindness things happening around you in your life. Perhaps something you are happy about, or something you noticed in general that cheers you up but you don't want to make a topic about. 

A bit of a contrast to all the negative stuff you might see in the news these days.

It might also be nice to maybe form a bit of community here. We'll see how this week goes, depending on it we might have a topic like this weekly.

Here's some questions to get things going if you need them:

* Has there been an event in your life that reminded you of the kindness of others?
* What stood out for you in the last week that made you smile?
* (cliche but...) What are you currently most grateful for? Could be family, friends, or even that new videogame you got. 

Please suggest if you have any additional questions also.

Anonymous witness to a random act of kindness,helixacle,"Got approached at Safeway by a homeless man with a chocolate lab. His voice was almost too rough to understand as he asked us if we would read to him the contents of a piece of paper that had been handed to him a few moments earlier. Said paper was a receipt from Safeway and accompanied a plastic card... Uncertainly, I bent to read the fine print. Turns out someone had bought the old solder a $100 gift card to Safeway! He staggered back in disbelief, then excused himself to go cry a little bit. Very honored to have witnessed this random act of kindness.",0

"Today, a stranger asked me if I was okay. Small, but it meant the world to me.",katie42674,"Just wanted to put this out into the universe. I was riding a very crowded subway today, clearly in a miserable mood. A young man standing next to me looked up from his book, and gently asked me if I was doing okay. 

I'm embarrassed to say that my first reaction was both cynical and unpleasant. (""Yeah, thanks."" Headphones back in.) 5 minutes later, with the guilt about my rudeness adding another shade to my already ugly emotional rainbow, he asked again. I tearfully apologized and thanked him. 

His response was full of understanding and kindness — two things that I've felt a lack of recently. Despite my initial jump to conclusions, he wanted nothing and expected nothing for his concern and compassion. 

I will probably never see him again, but I just wanted to do something to publicly acknowledge a stranger who did a great deal for me in a difficult moment. 

Thank you for upping the earth's pleasantness level. I will pay it forward the best I can.

Happened to me yesterday,nerdy4lyf-hwaiting,"I have had the worst month and yesterday my phone stopped working. The screen crapped out and im already struggling with money so I'm thinking well shit there's 175 down the hole, I will be short on rent and have to get my bill extend. So I walk into a tmobile  seeing if the can replace my phone there and I can get a new one of if I have to call and make a claim. The guy helping me tells me ""oh no you have to make a claim but we can give you a loaner we understand how important it is to have your phone and every thing so we can give you a loaner phone, but that's gonna be 50 dollars."" As I am trying to explain to him that I cant pay for a loaner and pay to get my phone replaced I just break down crying (the most embarrassing thing ever) and I see he's freaking out and I explain to him that money is just so tight and apologizing for breaking down like that he looks at me and says well I can give you the loaner for free... but you have to bring it back. My ray of hope and I just feel a little weight being lifted off my shoulders not much but enough to make a difference. So as he is filling out what he needs to a guy calls asking for a loaner phone and turns out he was giving me the last  one... Instead of taking the guys money he told the guy one the phone sorry we dont have anymore. That was probably the best thing that has happened to me all month.",0

To the Lady in the Drive-Thru (repost),juilettekoltwitz,"Sorry - this is a repost.  I posted it earlier this morning, this being my first reddit account, and was directed to post it here instead.  Just trying to reach this lady, somehow, some way.

[As a long time Reddit stalker, I created my first Reddit account in hopes of reaching out to this lady. If not, well...I tried. To the lady in the silver SUV in front of me at the Krispy Kreme drive-thru in Buford, GA this morning: You don't know me. You don't know that for the past 18 months, I have been horribly depressed, have lost all interest in my limited hobbies, and have a very jaded sense of our society as a whole. You do not know that I have had to deal with steadily decreasing health and am facing open heart surgery later this year, which terrifies me by the way as I am only 31. You have no idea that the sole reason for my visit to KK this morning was for the very limited caffeine I sometimes allow myself despite the fact my heart doctor has warned me against it. But today, not 10 minutes into my drive for work, I realized today was one of those days that I had to have it or I wasn't going to make it. KK just happened to be the closest stop that wasn't that dreadful McDonald's. You don't know that I wore myself out last night building a booth for my Girl Scout troop or even that I have one, in hopes of building a better generation of at least some. You did not know that I have been dealing with an incredibly shattered and broken heart for over a year after two specialists told me that having another child was off the table due to the state of my health. You are also not aware that despite the fact I did not know them, the deaths of Kelly Nash and Ally Oster in our small community have hit me deep and has given me nightmares of the passing of my own child. Nor do you know that February has historically been a month of hate for me, as too much sorrow takes place. You did not know that I have become sickened by mankind and their needless hate to one another to the point that I try not to venture far from the safety of the walls of my house. This morning, I was behind you for 15 minutes. I will be honest, I was slightly annoyed that you placed such a huge order at the drive-thru. Not so much because I had to wait, but because many times, it makes it hard on the employees and many companies hold them accountable for high wait times at the drive-thru. I was annoyed, but not for long and not all that much. I actually found myself rather enjoying the wait as a tiny sparrow had begun playing the most adorable game of peek-a-boo with me from the bushes. Of course, you did not know that. Every couple of seconds, his adorable little head would pop up like a jack-in-the-box. He would spot me looking at him, and quickly duck back down. I found myself smiling at such a mundane event. So cute, so peaceful, so simple. When you pulled out and I found myself at the window, I was shocked to discover my drink had been paid for by you. It seems you had felt bad for making me wait for 15 minutes and that was your way of making it right. But what you don't know is, you made more than just the wait right. You made me realize that maybe, just maybe, there is hope for society after all. You made me realize that people do care. You made me realize that out there are people who are trying themselves to right the wrong. To you dear lady, to what ever God you worship, bless you. From the bottom of my deeply shattered heart....bless you. Thank you. My morning's coffee was the best I have ever had because of you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/2vnpd8/thanks_to_the_lady_in_the_drivethru/)

Helped a stranger in the parking lot...,scorpio26krf,"Last night my fiance and I went to Petco to buy our kitties a new watering bowl. We pulled into the parking lot and got out of the car. As we started to walk towards the door we saw this man chasing after a paper drifting in the wind. It was extremely windy last night and he seemed to be struggling.     
     
So my fiance and I jumped into action trying to catch what we can now see is a $100 bill. I am in heels mind you, but that doesn't stop me. I slip running after it, fall and catch the bill between my legs. Proud of myself I exclaim I got it! The guy quickly says ""Great, hold on to it for a moment, I got over $2000 flying around here to catch"".    
    
That's when I notice all the other bills floating around the parking lot. I quickly get up, toss my shoes and purse to the side and join my fiance and this guy in chasing all the bills we can down.    
    
So here we are around 7pm, in a pretty dark large parking lot chasing down money floating in the wind. We probably looked crazy to the people in the parking lot but none of us cared, all we cared about was trying to collect as much of the guys money as possible.    
    
We probably spent a good 20mintues searching under cars and walking/running the whole length of the lot. The guy had to go back as soon as he realized he left his truck door open and keys just laying in the car. Luckily for him his truck wasn't touched.    
    
Cold, Tired and out of breath we regroup by his truck. We introduce ourselves, he gives us a hug and offers us 100$. We tell him no thank you, we were just glad to help. He also tried offering us furniture or a deal on a gun. He just opened a shop near by selling guns and it turns out the money was for his business. We politely decline and tell him we hope we got the majority of it and things get better for him and part ways.    
    
We didn't stick around for him to count and check how much we recovered, but my fiance and I are talking about stopping by and checking his shop out on Saturday so maybe we'll see him and find out. :)    
    
TL;DR; My fiance and I helped a guy chase down over 2000$ floating around in the wind at night in a large parking lot.",0
Man gets a ride,spartanwannabe,"It was last winter (the worst in a long time) the temperature reached -40C and even less with wind-chill.That day there were many families moving out of their homes to go to shelters because of the power cuts from falling frozen trees. I heard on the radio that all the hotels and shelters were filled up.

I was in a grocery store and I was having a conversation with the owner when a man walked in. He was big and had a lot of bags. From the moment he walked in he was shivering from the cold outside. He walked in and hesitantly said ""some gnarly weather eh?"" the owner replied ""yes it is, how may I help you?"", ""just looking"" said the man and he stayed in his spot, shivering.

The owner and I continued with our conversation and I noticed how the owner was always keeping an eye on him.
After a while the owner asked again ""what can I help you with, sir?"" the man looked up at him and started ""Brother you should know that its very hard for me right now, I don't know whether I'll be able to make it home tonight or not..."" his voice broke and he started tearing.

The owner didn't show much empathy and said ""why don't you just take the next bus home?"", the man replied ""I don't have the money, and I'm too late for the last bus anyway"" and continued to tear up.
I immediately thought that it was ridiculous of me to just stand there and not offer to help so I said ""I'll drive you home"" (I have a car) the owner looked at me with fear of the man doing something to me because of how big he is. Regardless I gave him my word and I would see it to the end. 

All this time the man was thanking me in all ways and offered to pay me whatever money he had, etc. 
I managed to keep the conversation going because I didn't want him to feel unwelcome in any way.
He told me about his divorced wife and kid, etc. The conversation took a turn that I wasn't expecting.
Soon in the middle of a road he told me to stop and drop him off, I looked around but I couldn't find any homes. So I asked ""where do you live?"" he said ""through these trees there is a tent pitched down, thats where I live"" .. I froze.

With all the shelters filled up I didn't know how else I could help the man, I looked in my bag and all I could find was some apples and a couple of hand warmers. I gave them to him with the hope they could be of any help.
After I drop him off, I see him walk through the wood and I take note of where he is heading. On my way home I keep thinking of ways to help the man. I phone up my brother and ask him to find out all the numbers of shelters in the area. I call all of them and finally find one shelter that has 3 spots left however they don't reserve spots. 
I turn the car around and rush to the place I dropped off the gentleman. I park the car and I start walking through the woods. I reach a point where the snow in knee high when I feel I'm in the wrong place. I look ahead and see a small tent pitched under the trees. I walk up to it and I call the man by his name, but no answer.
I don't want to unzip the tent and wake him up. So I call his name louder and louder. 
I then decided that if he is sleeping to the point where he can't hear me, then I think he is relatively comfortable.
I walk away feeling that I could've done more, but at least I drove him back.",0

Recently, a coworker of mine decided with his wife that they wanted to make a charitable contribution and chose my brother to receive the donation. $5,000.

Out for a movie and dinner with some friends and someone covered our bill,peters_pagenis,"This actually happened in summer of last year, 

I had plans with a friend of mine, Ray and another guy who I don't remember if he came or not. We were at buffalo wild wings near AMC saratoga, I had just gotten my first car and was talking with Ray when this guy who was sitting behind us overheard and he joined in the conversation as well. He was a really nice guy, he gave me a tip for an auto-body place as well as some easy to do mods to make it a little more comfortable. We talked for 25-30 minuted then I had to go to the bathroom, when I came back he told me and Ray he was gonna cover our bill because we seemed like nice kids. He told us to be nice and to pay it forward. We tipped a fair amount that time.

Dec of last year, I had gone back with Ray and a few other guys who know my reddit UID. We were at the same place and once we finished, we tipped the guy 25 percent on the bill, and it felt pretty damn good. We walked to the theatre and I paid for the lady behind me to see her movie just telling the ticket counter lady to please ask her to pay it forward.

Though I don't have I still give... and this last week has been a whopper for me ..,KittehWidget,"I have done more than I should in the last few weeks... and in turn I am sure it will (I am sure it did) bit me some .. but for all that it is I am not sad I did this. 

1) I hired a man to be on our apartment maintenance crew and found out he had been shorted on his check for rent from his other part time job -- by $433... I happened to have gotten a decent bonus and so I gave that to him to save his apartment, my sanity and his job that he just got. He wouldn't have this job with a normal hiring as he has bad credit and bad rental history... but now he has a one bedroom apartment and a job he can make of what he will along with his other part time job... 

2) Gave a homeless man the $6 (and helpful information of places to stay and eat)  I had in cash on me last night while picking up a tenants mother from the train as she had gone into labor and had her baby before her mom arrived. I took the hour to drive (round trip) from home to train station to hospital and stayed a bit then drove the mom back to the apartments. ... 

3) Have been offering rides to homeless whom claim they are stranded and getting a 50/50 response of acceptance.. 

4) Have been handing out men , women and child coats from my van when I see people in need -- shoes too if I have them.. I have handed out a dozen so far this week... 


Though I try to pay it forward a lot and as often as I am able I think this week took the cake as I just got a call today that my father is in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time and so I will work and am now looking for a second job to make all ends meet and save in case there are more emergencies.. 

Thank you to all that give and give you all make me amazingly happy to be part of the good crowd! ",0
I am on vacation in the Caribbean and I am getting a lot more pleasure from giving strangers money than giving it to resorts...,,"I saw a homeless lady picking up trash and gave her the $20 I was going to give to the resort for beach chair and umbrella. Have looked for other chances to do it as well just to random folks not just the homeless ones. Consider doing something similar either at home or on vacation. I also love that they are thankful and I will never see them again. :)

Update: There was a lady selling fruits on the side of the street and she politely smiled and asked if I wanted and sweet Caribbean bananas. I did want a banana because they are delicious here but I over paid her and she had the biggest smile on her face. Probably didn't need it but I told her to buy her kids something nice. ",0
I was hungry and a raok happened in a pub. No one revealed who it was.,mylifeissucky,"I was in a pub that served many foods along with the usual designer beers and so on. I heard someone order burgers and I looked at the clipboard menu list on the wall and somehow mumbled EVER SO SILENTLY,""that burger would be good"". I tried to mumble that as silently as I could.

Later, I go out for a smoke and come back in and spot cutlery placed on my table and thought that the server may have made a mistake and thought nothing more of it.

Somehow, a waitress came directly pointed at my table holding a burger. I was wondering that ""Hey! You MUST have a wrong table. I don't believe I ordered that"".

She goes ""Someone bought this for you"". I cried. Happy tears. I smelled a rat, thinking the booth behind me ordered it. I told them thank you, just in case. Just a random act of kindness from someone, somewhere.",0
I dropped my bus money in the snow...,srkambbs1,"It was very cold today where I live as we had a cold warning issued. My bus arrives every 45 minutes and I barely missed my previous one. I had exact change for the bus. So once I entered the bus to pay the money that I'd been holding in my hand with gloves on, I realized I only had 1$ while it costed 3.50$. I started panicking. It probably slipped from my hands and fell into the snow and I didn't realize it because of the gloves. The person behind me approached and paid the rest amount for me. I was so thankful. I asked him if I could get his number to pay him back or if he takes this bus everyday so I could pay him back tomorrow. He replied saying that the way I could repay him is by helping forward. I will try to live my life by this motto.",0

Forgot my debit card. Saintly woman behind me paid for my coffee and doughnuts,Cinnamon_In_It," So I remembered my wallet but somehow managed to leave my debit card at home. After waiting in line at my local krispy kreme for twenty minutes, I made my order of a dozen doughnuts and a small latte, only to realize my lack of funds at the checkout. Without any solicitation or having even spoken to her this wonderful lady named Robby put her money down on the counter and said ""this should cover it"" 

 I was absolutely stunned, I am so used to people being mean and nasty all the time I didn't know what to say or do. I just told her that I can't let her do that and that it's OK, I can just come back. Well she was as stubborn as she was kind and refused to take no for an answer. I asked ""is there anything I can do for you?"" She said ""just pass it on""  and reddit I'm here to tell you I will. I think we need more people like this in the world. Yes they were just doughnuts and I probably didn't need them anyway but this experience has really touched me, a man that finds it hard to ha e any faith in humanity most of the time.",0

Random Kindness on the Appalachian Trail,wmccrani35,"So I'm new to Reddit and this happened quite a while ago, but I found this sub and it seemed appropriate so...here we go! In 2012 I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail from Maine to Georgia and really learned how awesome people can be, but one experience will always stand out. I was about 2 or 3 months into the trip and ended up walking a stretch from Connecticut through New York and New Jersey into Pennsylvania (about 3 weeks) without having a single rest day, shower, or night in a bed. It was hot and dry and I was miserable to the point of sitting down and crying alone one night. The next day I stopped for lunch and a father/son pair came hiking up and sat down to eat, gave me some fresh fruit (awesome!) and told me about how they were cutting their 2 night trip short because the dad needed a shower. ""Oh yeah, wait til you hear about my experience!"" I say, and proceed to spill out my heart to them about the last few weeks. After I was done, they invited me to come stay with them in a nearby timeshare, gave me a bed, shower, 3 hot meals, and a ride back to the trail. I, a complete stranger, got to stay with their family and get rejuvenated for free. It's an act of kindness I will never forget, and if they're out there and reading this, I hope they know how much thsir kindness meant to me. It was a life-changing experience and I hope one day I'll be able to do the same for someone else who's having a hard time. ",0
Kindness Nor LOVE are weak...Nor are either ever depleted when shared...they only grow when shared.,,"When shared kindness & love grows and spreads forward in other peoples words, intentions, and deeds. When you share love & kindness it doesn't deplete it grows. And by no means is either weak. I have seen people do great feats in the name and because of love. Both fortifies us and heals us. The two work hand in hand. Think about it when facing some of lifes most difficult task isn't it easier when your not alone. And also a strong person secure in who they are never feels the need to tear the next human being down to make them self feel or look better, it's all love & kindness people have you shared it today...<3",0
It started with one man,OCSlacker714,"It started 4 years ago. My wife always saw this homeless man near where she works ( his name is Mitch and a very nice man). It was the week before Christmas and she said she wanted to buy him a new coat. His was torn and very old. We don't have a lot of money, really we are a step away from being homeless ourselves most months but we try to help when we can. We talked and found a way to get some money together to buy him a coat. I thought since we are giving him a coat let's look at what else he might need. We brainstormed and decided to fill a backpack with useful things, a toothbrush, soap,wash clothes, a hat, gloves, deodorant, razor, some food, etc. and a small gift  & Christmas card. 

A few days later a check came in the mail. It was completely unexpected. A merchandizing company I work for was sued & they had to pay us for travel time, entry times etc. It was not much, just a few hundred dollars but wow did it come at the perfect time. I thought, let's make 5 backpacks & give them out on Christmas eve to people who would otherwise have nothing to open. 

We know what that's like. We haven't had money to exchange gifts for birthdays or Christmas in many many years too. It feels wonderful to have someone think of you at Christmas and truth be told, I've always been a little embarrassed when friends ask ""what did you get for Christmas/birthday."" It always makes my wife feel bad that she can't afford to give me anything and I feel the same . So much so, that I would lie and say she bought me this thing or that, to avoid the ""oh, I'm so sorry chatter."" but that year we could say we gave to others instead and that's exactly what happened.

It's incredible, people asked and we said what we did. . They wanted to help the following year and we made 10 backpacks the following Christmas, 15 the year after and this year we really expanded. We work with two local police department groups called H.E.A.R.T. & local volunteers to help distribute the bags, We set up a GoFundMe account, accepted donations of canned goods, new socks, a friend works at a department store and used her friends & family discount to get us 50 brand new backpacks that would have regularly cost us $3200 for $200. All which were gifted to us from her and another generous supporter.  My job brings me to CVS often and I was able to get 50 blankets at a deep discount when the store manager heard why I needed so many and the most incredible part is another friend in LA saw the post and she put together 25 backpacks to give out this year with her daughters. 

I still can't afford to give my wife something to open on Christmas day ( secret santa instead) but the joy we feel giving out these backpacks on Christmas eve makes up for it 10 fold!!! 

Next year we go bigger!! Merry Christmas!!

"Witnessed Christmas Kindness, then more RAK ensued....",beautifulsouth00,"So I work at a thrift store and we were asked to get a bunch of big boxes and do a carry out for a guy who was buying ""a bunch of blankets.""  When I went up with the boxes, I asked the customer, ""Are you buying these for the homeless?""  and when he replied affirmatively, I gushed.  ""Oh thank you so much!!!  That's so nice of you..."" etc, etc.  He said something like ""Thank YOU for thanking me,"" and then I was tasked with something else and I was off.
      I found out later from a cashier that after the commotion I made about this guy basically buying all the blankets and comforters off of our shelves, people in the line started offering small donations to help him out.  I'm glad I'm such a loud mouth!",0
Helping Out Workers in the Retail Industry This Week,4darunner,"Last night, I went out last minute gift shopping for my wife and its a mad house in every store.  I go in to Victoria's Secret, and I start looking for things that my wife mentioned she wanted: Sweatpants, Long Sleeve Shirts, tank tops.  If you've been in VS recently, VS's Pink has 4 different styles of sweat pants at any given time (don't even bother trying to count the colors of each style too), 6 different styles of shirts, etc. I'm standing there looking at the sweat pants for a good minute not moving, just examining how many styles there are, and at this point I'm thinking that a gift card will be best so I don't screw up and get her the wrong thing.

Suddenly, someone who works at the store asks me if I need help, and I said a little discouraged ""my wife wants a pair of sweat pants, but I'm not entirely sure which kind she wants.""  She proceeded to ask me what type of style sweat pants she likes wearing, I told her loose but not baggy, and she took me to where that style was.  She then asked if there was anything else, and we went on to the next thing.  Before I knew it I had a pair of sweat pants, two long sleeve thermal shirts, and a few tank tops in my hand and it was everything my wife asked for.  She gave me her name and wished me a happy holiday, and I went off to the checkout line.

When I was standing in line (which took about 20 minutes), I started to think about how much she helped me and how friendly she was.  When I got to the front of the line, the cashier asked me if I found everything alright, and I said ""yes, I did, but can I speak with a manager, please? Any manager on duty is fine, the message will still get across.""  He, and the 2 other cashiers on either side of him had a face that looked like ""another stupid customer complaining that the line is long the week of Christmas"" or ""ugh, the line is huge, there are other customers here"" or ""shit shit manager is coming up, shit shit shit shit act like I know what I'm doing.""  (You know what I'm talking about, we've all had that facial expression before)

When the manager came up, she introduced herself to me and said ""Hey, I'm the manager on duty, what can I help you with?"" And I said, ""I just wanted to let you know first hand that (this employee) working the floor at the front, she helped me out, she did a fantastic job and helped me find everything I needed.""

All the cashiers were listening in on what I had to say, and it seemed like there was a collective sigh of relief that no one was going to get chewed out, and they all seemed pretty cheerful after that.  Some of the other customers were listening in too and I heard one of them give a surprised ""ohhh!"" too, so maybe she thought that calling a manager was only for complaining.  I also mentioned that the cashier I had did a good job calling her (still speaking to the manager) and he still had a smile on his face and continued with ringing up the items.  The manager thanked me for telling her that the workers are doing a good job.  When I was leaving, I saw the manager I just spoke with talking to the worker that helped me, and the worker had a big smile and was nodding her head, so I can only assume that the manager relayed the message of praise to her.

So, long story short: This week (and really all weeks moving forward), if a worker helps you out in a retail store, it doesn't hurt at all to let their manager know that they helped you out and did a good job.  It could just make their day (both manager and employee) a little brighter.  Also, use this kindness tool only when necessary, and hopefully that's often.",0

Not your typical Craigs List experience,Mcdthe713,"While craigslist is a solid place to find great deals on used stuff of pretty much all kinds, more often than not you hear stories about people getting ripped off, robbed or just having an unpleasant experience when meeting with strangers through the site. Recently I met to purchase a bike from a guy who wanted to change that negative view of CL.

To start off I need to say that I was in the market for a new BMX because mine had been stolen from my apt. off my 2nd story balcony.... (fuckin thieves). So of course I went to Craigslist to spend my renters insurance AND to see if I found my bike being pawned off by the thief. 

I came across a sweet free agent bmx that was well in my price range ($150) and contacted the seller. We met so I could scope out the goods and told him I would return another day to purchase the bike. During the week while planning when to meet he texts me saying he will take onl $100 for it... Now I'm just thinking he wants to seal the deal and make the sale rather than not. Score. 

Now comes the day we meet. He rides up on the bike and begins telling me how much negative BS happens through craigslist and how its an issue. I tried to ease his mind by handing him the money right then but he motioned for me to hold off. Wierd, but I continue to hear him out and, low and behold he starts saying how it's the christian season of advent and he's feeling particularly generous as well. And between his generosity and wanting to shed a positive light on CL he had to decide to...... GIVE ME THE BIKE FOR FREE.
Now I'll admit a part of me thought well shit maybe he just stole this bike and is trying to clear his conscience by gifting it. But in the long run I believed in the sincerity of his schpeel and found him to just be a genuine guy, and I sure hope that is the case because I assured him that this story would be told and that I would 'pay foward' his awesome gesture in some way in the future. Good Guy Craigslist Seller.

tl;dr- Bike stolen, guy off craigslist gave me his for free. Still good people out there. Merry XMAS.

Today I postponed a RAoK and was able to do another one instead,unlimitedanna,"There is a railway about ten minutes from where I live which is often frequented by homeless migrants. During the past couple of days, I've considered giving each of them a goodie bag. However, traffic is really packed in that exact spot and I fear what could happen if I give all the goodie bags to one person to share. Anyways, today was supposed to be my grocery shopping day but I kept postponing it.  
Right now money is a bit tight, so I had spared just about enough to make the bags. Suddenly I hear a knock in the door, so I answered.  
There was a man standing in the front porch, asking me if he could work for me in exchange of some money. He said he was a construction worker but with Christmas coming up he wanted to make some extra money. I had large weeds in the front yard and I asked how much he would charge me for cutting them down. He said a neighbor had paid him the equivalent of 2 USD for doing that. I was really impressed, as a local gardener charges up to 20 times that to do the same work.  
I told him he could help me out with the weeds and he started cutting them from the root up. He had no gloves, or equipment. I lent him some gardening gloves I had because I didn't want him to struggle so much. He ended up finishing within an hour a chore that it would have taken me a whole day to do. He even put the weeds in trash bags and placed them in the curb so they will be picked up tomorrow. I ended up giving him the money I had spared for the goodie bags because he had done a great job.  
I might be low in funds but doing that lifted up my spirits.

What if it was my mom looking for help?,tinyvoid,"My young daughter and I had just spent a few hours at the mall, the last of which she spent playing in the kids area while I zoned out.  As usual, she pitches a huge fit when it's time to leave.  I had just gotten her into the car and buckled in (despite her howled protests) when a woman approached me.  Very quietly she asks me if I can help her get to a battered woman's shelter.  I tell her that I can't help her and make some excuse.  There's no way that I'm letting a stranger into my car, especially with my kid in the back seat.  I'm thinking that she's going to ask me for money because it's just a scam to get some money anyway, but she just says thank you and walks away.

As I drove off, I started thinking about my own mom.  She had been in an abusive relationship.  My bio-father beat her and us kids pretty regularly.  What if it was her walking around in 20 degree weather just trying to get some help to get away from him?  What if no one would help her?

I still wasn't comfortable with letting a stranger into my car, so I went to the nearest drive-thru ATM and pulled out some money.  I couldn't give her a ride, but I could give her money to get a cab and maybe something to eat.  I drove circles around the mall parking lot until I found her again.  When I gave her the money, she started to cry.  She showed me her bruises and where her husband had hit her so hard that he'd broken the skin above her eyebrow.

I get so jaded sometimes and so stuck in my assumption that everyone is out to take me for a ride that I forget that some people really do need help.",0
I've adopted a family for Christmas. Also random layaway paid.,teev00,"During a time when I was feeling down, a kind stranger gave me kind words. After some correspondence, we became friends and I realized she was showing me so much kindness and support when she herself was having some issues. In short, I sort of adopted her and her kids. Trying to make sure their holidays will be fantastic -- gift cards, games for family time, arts & craft supplies (as the awesome kids send me pictures they've drawn).

I made friends, and they keep me going. I may not be suffering much in the physical financial aspect, but having a friend when I needed it was priceless.


Also, I tend to roam stores, and look at the items they have on layaway and pay off some of the amounts, leaving a small remaining balance. Hope they pay it forward!",0
Today I gave my cousin a gift.,SeepingGoatse,"My cousin graduated into the Marine Core last week and I haven't been able to get him anything. This kid grew up without a father, who until recently pretended he didn't exist and avoided child support. I decided to give him the money I'd saved for my own Christmas gift. 

I'm in no way rich,  in fact,  I'm poor. But I hadn't always been and he had. I knew he wanted the PS4 because we'd talked about playing together after he shipped off across the country.  Between my wedding savings and bills I managed to save enough for one system. 

I gave that to him today. He knew it was my Christmas money,  and the tears and thanks I got made up for the loss. I'm so happy to see him happy. That's the greatest reward. 

Happy holidays everyone!",0

The woman who saved my mother's Thanksgiving,,"**This story is rather long, but it's how a daughter in the UK got her mother a Thanksgiving Turkey. I don't know how this subreddit works, but if anyone can do anything to thank this woman, I will be forever in their debt.**

From around 3pm today, I have been attempting to purchase a turkey for my mother. I found a place that is about an hour from their home, and they had a nice smoked turkey that came pre-cooked, and they'd gotten awesome reviews. I had emailed them last night about setting an order for a specific date. They'd told me to ring.

I called them up. I asked if I could please place an order....they asked for the address. The form wouldn't take the address. They said, we'll call you back. They called me back, and suggested I try and spend online.

I go to the website. I get a 500 Internal Server Error. NOT on my end. I call up their site administrator and we spend an hour on the phone together going over how we might fix this. We tried EVERYTHING. Absolutely everything.

Then I said...what about Paypal?

I knew I'd have to ask my husband later, but we'd agreed on the price, and goddammit I was going to get this turkey to my mother.

""I'll put you through!"" says the helpful woman. 

The call drops.

""I'll put you through!"" this time it's an answer machine.

We go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth for AN HOUR, trying to call each other.

I get to talk to her. She says - ""Our PayPal doesn't take international transfers.""

I break down. It's been four hours and I'm just imagining what Thanksgiving will be like without a turkey. Dad had said: ""I'll just buy a chicken breast! It will be ok!""

He might have thought it was ok, but I knew it wasn't ok with my mother, and when I told my grandmother that he said that later, she went ""That's stupid."" This is a sentimenal time of year. The last very poor Christmas they had, she cried for hours.

I sob on the phone to this woman as I tell her that my mother can't afford a turkey for Thanksgiving and I really just want her to have one. It's the holiday season, and I will do literally anything she asks as long as I can get this goddamn turkey!

""I'll call you back"" she says

10 minutes later she calls back.

""You sounded so upset, and I know your mother can't afford a turkey. Don't worry. I've bought it. It'll be with her soon. It's my good deed for the holidays.""

THIS WOMAN SPENT HER OWN MONEY ON MAKING A STRANGER'S THANKSGIVING.

That woman got flowers. That woman got flowers, delivered to her office, today. That woman got the best flowers I could get and damn if they weren't pretty with a heartfelt note on them.

She's getting a picture of my family cutting the turkey and enjoying it. She's getting that damn picture. She's the best person in the whole world today. She made a difference. With turkey.",0

Found two wallets this year,Threeblessings,I recently found a second wallet this year.  After returning both to their owners I just wanted to share the goodness that came out of it.  I was given a random voucher in a shop to save some money when I bought my 3 kids shoes over the weekend.  I also drove over a screw and a random stranger stopped me and offered to change it.  He was like an angel!  I also went grocery shopping and a random lady asked me to swipe my rewards card against her shopping!  Some people are just awesome!  Never in a million years could I have kept either wallet.  The first had a substantial amount of money but I wanted to show my children the importance of honesty by ensuring they witnessed the wallets being returned to their rightful owners.

Thank you for driving me home!,4nr-,"Not sensational by any means but here's a little story that might lift some moods.

Taking the last train home from Brussels into suburban Belgium at around midnight. I tried to get off at my station but the doors wouldn't open, so I'm forced to get off at the next one and walk the 6km (>4mi) home.  I intended on using Google Maps to get there but my phone dies as I walk off the train.  There's no sign to my town but there is one that says ""all directions"", so I follow it for about 20 minutes until I catch a man at a gas station.  I tell him my story and although he's sceptical at first, he offered to drive me home despite the fact that he needed to go in another direction and was only filling up to save time the next morning because he has to be somewhere by 7 and needs to drop off his kids first.

He didn't end any wars in the Middle East, but he made me happier than I would otherwise have been.   So thanks for that.",0

Life's a beach,QrtJester,"My roommate Chiara was at Ocean Beach today in San Francisco, on a scorcher of an afternoon. A random woman comes running up frantically, planting her feet on Chiara's blanket, and sighing in relief before proceeding to apologize. The sand had reached a temperature just too hot for her little bare feet to bear. Unfortunately, she had left her sandals back at the car, where a friend was waiting. With no means available for her to reach this friend, Chiara kindly offered to put on her own sandals and march the 10 minutes round trip to find the friend, retrieve the sandals, and rescue this poor woman from the blistering trek back. Chiara succeeded, and after an outpouring of gratitude, the lady put her sandals on and set off to brave the world once again. Later that evening, Chiara discovered a $50 bill stuffed inside her beach bag; a sneaky token of thanks from a fellow human in need.",0

An internet hero got me to the hospital last night.,Fozibare,"On Monday afternoon, I went to the hospital for surgery, and went home shortly after waking up. 

For the next several hours, the pain was much more than I expected. Despite an Oxy prescription, and the fact I've been through more significant injuries and surgeries before, I was alarmed, but dealing with the pain. 

The more bothersome issue to me was that the bleeding didn't stop, and every couple minutes, there was another drop of blood.

So I called the 24 hour nurse listed on my discharge paper and described what was going on. After a couple minutes on hold, I was asked to return to the hospital within the hour.

So, late at night, without a car, without taxi fare or credit card, and unable to find a ride amongst the people at my rooming house, I turned to the Internet.

posting in /r/Seattle , I asked for help with a ride: [here's the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/2hywmc/anyone_able_to_help_me_get_from_the_udistrict_to/).

Within a couple minutes, I got a PM, and after a short flurry of notes, /u/_canela_  told me there would be an Uber car at the end of my block in a matter of minutes. 

It was the first time I'd asked total strangers to come to my aid over the internet and I am amazed at the effect. 

Thank you again to the stranger who helped me, and Thanks also to the stranger who gifted them with gold.

A homeless guy did this for me.,,"I was doing this crappy market research job where I'd stand outside supermarkets and ask people for their receipts if they didn't need to keep them. A lot of people were nice but many weren't and I couldn't really blame them: it's a weird request from some random guy with a clipboard. I was often wet and cold and on this day I was shivering. 

There was a guy on the other side of the glass with a trolley full of shopping who had that weathered look of a homeless person with drug problems and he came out to say hello and ask what I was doing. He told me I looked freezing and I said I'd be finished in a couple of hours and could get warm. He said the trolley was full of stuff for his new flat that he'd gotten help with moving into just that day. It was his first shopping in six years and he'd been on the street that long. He was waiting for a lift and then he'd be buying pots and pans and couldn't wait to cook his own dinner. Then he went inside and gave me an energy drink and a bag of crisps: ""That'll keep you going!"" When I thanked him he said that you have to look after people on the street whether they live there or not.
I can only imagine the shit he took over six year sleeping rough and it was something else that he hadn't become a total cynic about the general public.

I ate the crisps but I still have the energy drink years later. When I'm feeling cynical, one look at it snaps me out of it.",0

My internet friend (whom I met on Reddit) helped me in my time of need by buying music,RebeccaETripp," have a cat (Dandy Lion) who is sick right now. He's my best friend in the world, and I grew up with him. He's 13 now, and he's been hospitalized for over a month now. Between my family and I, we don't even have enough to pay the deposits, let alone all the various treatments that he's undergone- draining fluid from the lungs, medicine, pain killers, xrays, antibiotics... the works.

Near the beginning, I told my friend about this, as I was very distraught and needed to talk to someone; it was a 100% guarantee that Dandy would die if he was not treated immediately, but my family and I could barely even afford food that month.

My friend then emailed me back and told me that he had been planning to buy my collection of music (I'm a semi professional composer) for $3 a tack, which amounted to almost $800 Canadian. I was able to pay the deposit and help my kitty.

My cat is still very ill, and the vet said that he has heart failure. They are most likely going to put him down in 2 days.  I'm devastated beyond description, but the kindness of my online friend has significantly reduced my debt and allowed me to have an extra month with Dandy Lion.  I will never forget his kindness, and I may always feel kindly about other people after this.",0

He promised his kids ice cream.,KuanYinsDaughter,"I was driving home from work and pulled up to the busy intersection right before the highway - it's a pretty unforgiving spot in terms of traffic flow. Right in the center lane, a very beat up car is spewing smoky stuff, and an exasperated, barefooted man is looking very forlornly at an open hood while his two young sons - maybe 5 and 6 - stand beside him. The younger one is clearly getting ancy and dad's torn between trying to keep them in the car and risk it getting hit because someone didn't see his 4-ways flashing, or holding their hands and risk an erratic driver sideswiping the lot of them. Whatever went wrong with their car had clearly just happened.

I swung into a bank parking lot beside the intersection, hopped out, crossed the street and hastily introduced myself (as a former nanny), offering to take his young sons to the safety of the corner instead of remaining in the middle of the street while the police were en route. He nodded, and I took one little boy's hand in each of mine and the three of us walked safely to the parking lot while dad remained with the car but still in sight of us. I rummaged in my trunk and produced a few bottles of bubbles and some sidewalk chalk and kept the kids having fun and staying entertained while dad explained things to the cop that'd just pulled up. Dad and the cop managed to push the car into the bank parking lot, where I returned the two little gents to their dad and they all piled into the car to await the mom to come and rescue them, a good 45 minutes out.

He thanked me profusely but still looked very hot, tired and close to tears. I gently asked him what was wrong and he told me that the boys had their first day at school that day and he'd promised them ice cream as a reward for behaving for their new teachers. He confided in me quietly that he felt like a failure, what with the car being broken now and not being able to do what he wanted to for his boys. I tried to give him some encouraging words before I left, but I could tell he was still very disappointed in himself. 

I turned away from the highway onramp and went to Burger King instead, where I ordered two vanilla cones and a large coke for overheated dad. When I came back to his car and knocked on his window, he looked at me like I was an angel of soft serve and thanked me with a catch in his voice. He told me that I had completely saved the day and made a streak of bad luck seem more like a little bump in the road.

There but for the grace of...something...go I, I figure. How many times have we been heartbroken or hopeless and in a place where a stupid little ice cream cone can make everything okay again? Help where you can, because it's so, so important, especially in the world we all share today.",0

A small token from a stranger made my day,Sinhumane,"This happened last month, at the end of an absolutely horrible week for me. Dealing with a stressful divorce, lots of stress at work and at home. I had just finished moving the night before at 430am and had to report to my unit at 7. 

On my lunch break I had stopped by my shop to borrow a charger for my phone, got grief from the manager and nearly snapped. Tired, dehydrated and hungry I stopped in at Pizza Hut for lunch. I was in uniform, and sat alone near the back of the restaurant to gather my thoughts. The waitress had brought me the bill, and shortly before I left she came and picked it up from my table without my card. I asked her who had paid, she pointed out a man and his family at an adjacent table. They had thanked me for my service as I was getting my food earlier. 

I froze up completely and was totally speechless. On the verge of breaking down into tears from all the pent up emotion... I walked over and all I could muster was a handshake and a thank you before I got choked up. 

I quickly left, and the moment I sat down in my car I completely let loose... This man, not knowing me decided on a whim to make such a small gesture, but it struck pretty deep. When nobody I knew could help me get through what I was dealing with... He extended an act of kindness that sticks with me every time I think about the chaos my life is in. I just wish he knew how much it meant to me.",0

He was under the hood, bent over the engine, and his female companion WAS USING HER CELL PHONE AS A FLASHLIGHT, pointing it at whatever he was doing. It obviously wasn't going anywhere til whatever he was doing got done.  Well, I know nothing about cars, but I know the feeling when one is stranded until the issue gets fixed, and I figured that maybe I could be of some help.  So I drove my truck into the parking space facing him, turned off the engine, and left my lights on.  I honestly had nowhere to be, and I was prepared to sit for an hour or two to give them a light source.  He looked up, waved, finished whatever he was doing in less than 10 minutes, then started the car up. He waved to let me know he was done, and I left.

Stranger insulted my boyfriend until he accepted a gift,kateishere,"Me and my boyfriend are pretty poor at the moment. We're both students.  
Last night we had a just enough change after groceries to treat ourselves to a beer each.  
My boyfriend went to the bottle shop, picked two beers and went to pay for them. The store clerk said he couldn't accept his money, as one of the coins we had was damaged. It was grinded down and missing like 20% off on the side of it.   
The guy behind my boyfriend said to him ""Don't worry about it, I'll buy you a six pack"". My boyfriend really doesn't like accepting ""charity"", so he told the stranger not to worry about it. 
Then this stranger said to him ""What are you, a pussy? You have to learn to accept gifts! Go to the fridge and get a case!"" He tried to decline, but the stranger was very insistent, and said that he must learn to accept gifts that are given.   
 
The stranger bought the case, my boyfriend thanked him very much, and then the stranger left. We live in Australia, so tax makes the value of the case like $50. The stranger wasn't drunk, and he didn't seem unusual. It was so unexpected.

Smallest act of kindness made what just happened better.,admiral_meow,"After work tonight, I rushed out of work to catch my bus.  As I'm heading to the stop, I watched it zoom by.  I decided to walk up the street and wait for a different bus.  But I had a bit of time to kill so I wandered into the Tim Hortons and ordered a Tea.  The usual.

Knowing 100% I had the money to pay for it, I ordered with confidence.  I use my debit card everywhere and I was paying as he made my tea (efficient)!  Declined.  Oh, that's odd... none of my payments have come out yet, and I should still have plenty for rent and food!  I tried again.  Declined.  I asked him to hold on a moment while I checked my online banking.

I was clearly distressed, as I knew something was amiss.  The guy behind the counter had of course finished making my tea by then and had handed it to me.  He informed me, it was free today.  I insisted he wait a moment because I couldn't just accept the tea, at no charge!  He in turn insisted, otherwise he'd be throwing the tea out and didn't want to waste such deliciousness!

So I found the source of my problem.  Someone made an unauthorized payment to a random PayPal service with my bank account.  I have NO idea how they did it, it wasn't that my PayPal that authorized the payment.  Anyway, when I was clearly distraught, this employee did such a small thing, that helped me calm down immensely. 

When I get my money back, I'm thinking I go back to that Tim Hortons and find that employee to give him $5 (the tea was less than $2).  I know it's not much, but I just want to express to him how thankful I was in that moment and still am over two hours later.

tl;dr - Debit card declined at Tim Hortons, found out my account was compromised, employee gave me free tea.  Should I go back and give him $5 for his generosity?",0

"I almost lost my grandma this week. But thanks to the talent at Mayo Clinic and the kindness of strangers, she's beaten all odds.",bostonbedlam,"--Backstory:

My grandma was one of the first people to ever have open-heart surgery. When she was young, the procedure was still mostly experimental. She had it done at
Mayo Clinic, and she was in the headlines of newspapers all around her home state. She was somewhat of a celebrity. She felt like a freak and ever since has lead a very private life.

She's now in her 60s, which is quite an accomplishment in itself. Add to that a lifetime of smoking and enjoying her scotch, it's kind of extraordinary she's still going strong with little sign of slowing down.

Unfortunately, recently she started having chest problems and saw a doctor about it. He found a troubling problem with her heart, which I'll touch back on later. Another open-heart surgery was scheduled at Mayo Clinic for August of this year (this past Wednesday). Becasue of her age and some other risk factors, we were all really nervous leading up to the big day. Fearing her luck may be running out, she agreed to quit smoking, which nobody ever believed would happen. My grandma is kind of a badass, and doesn't like people telling her what to do.

--The surgery and the battle after:

Then the day of the operation came. Surgery seemed to go well. Awesome! She might be recovered enough to come to my wedding in two months! We're out of the woods, right?

When she was taken to ICU for recovery,  everything derailed. Fast. 

She went into a spontaneous and resistant ventricular fibrillation, and began bleeding internally, necessitating re-opening her chest, manual heart massage and a search for the cause of the arrhythmia. The volume of blood and the rate she was losing it alarmed the team and prevented finding the cause of the problem. As they forced units of blood into her and attempted to get her hooked up to the ECMO machine (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenator) which functions much like the bypass machine used in the OR, they packed her head in ice for oxygen conservation and the hopeful prevention of neurological death.

Eventually, a rupture in the side of the right ventricle heart muscle was found to be the cause of the blood loss, was sutured, her blood volume restored and the hookup to ECMO completed. The tear in the heart wall occurred in the part that has been stretched to over twice its normal size by backpressure from the faulty valve the surgery replaced. The clock showed **33 minutes** the team worked to get her stabilized, some of which time she had zero blood pressure and there was no profusion of blood going to vital organs or the brain. We were told this morning that at one point the left ventricle of her heart was completely empty of blood, but normal heart function has been restored.

She was later put into an induced coma to promote uninterrupted healing. As she came out of a second surgery, to further repair damage, the surgeon said her pupils were reactive, which blew everyone away.

The next morning the team was reducing her sedation in an attempt to get a better picture of her vital signs. As they prepared to reduce her dependence on the ECMO machine, she awoke spontaneously on her own with eyes open, responding to questions with nods, squeezing hands and giving some readings and indicators the team described as being nothing short of extraordinary. When we came back to the hospital, the ICU became a place of celebration.

The family had originally been scared witless when they arrived at the ICU when they were greeted by the sight of around 12 team members gathered around my grandma’s bed, reminiscent of the view of the team saving her life the day before. An employee ‘Communicator’ reassured them it was all good, that it was a teaching and education moment for the team with a critique of what transpired the day before. Everyone joined at her bedside, and again her eyes popped open as we gave her words of encouragement and played one of her favorite songs. As everyone tried to joke with her, she even showed a little smile at times around her ventilator.

--Today:

Grandma's heart did well with a couple preliminary tests not using the ECMO.  Her heart performed well and showed good strength according to the Mayo team. There has been a gradient change with valve flow, but we're told it's not super concerning.  They have taken chest X-rays to look at her lungs, and today has been an improvement from yesterday, but the staff has decided to wait a couple of days before taking her off of ECMO. They want her strength to improve so she can ""fly off of the ECMO "". 

While she was having another echocardiogram, the entire family went to the blood donor center, donating blood. We created a donor group for her, and a complete stranger offered to donate to her group. In order to specify that the blood went to her first,  we needed to donate a minimum of 10 units. Although it would have been perfectly fine had it gone to someone else in need instead, in a matter of 3 hours, 7 more donors (who were also strangers) added to our donations so we would have our 10!! If she does need it, great. But if not, we can only hope that someone else is helped by the donations as we were by other kind individuals.

**tl;dr: my grandma was dead for 33 minutes and appears to be recovering at an unbelievable rate. 7 strangers donated blood for her within 3 hours.**

*If you read all of this, thank you so much!! I hope it shows you how amazing people can be and how much some can endure. I hope it inspires you in some way.*",0
I inadvertently helped out a lot of homeless people a couple days ago. Feels good.,,"Two days ago, my boyfriend and I had to move out of our apartment and drive halfway across the country. (In another month, we'll be driving the other half). We're not quite there yet, but we will be soon enough. 

In any case, after getting rid of half of our belongings (selling books, movies, clothes), we ended up giving a whole bunch of our kitchen items, clothing, furniture, etc to Goodwill. I then posted a link on craigslist advertising that we had a lot of free non-perishables to give away; I ended up getting **a lot** of phone calls and e-mails, and in the end gave the food (3 large boxes worth of canned goods, pasta, etc, and a box of vitamins and various over the counter medicines) to a church that goes out and delivers to the needy on a daily basis.

I felt really bad for every person I couldn't individually donate to, so I got the information for the church, and passed it along to each person I spoke to. I also spoke to the church and gave them the names of some of the people I had spoken to.

It ended up taking up a good chunk of essential cleaning and packing time, but I believe it was well worth it. I even referred a few people to a disability lawyer I used to work with, as a lot of the people I spoke to were excellent candidates for her services (which have no up front cost!)

Anyway. I just felt good about this, so I wanted to throw it up here. I posted here a week or two ago, misguided, asking for advice on how to help people in some way, and was sent over to /r/randomkindness. Also a lovely subreddit!",0

I avoided the tread and pulled over about a hundred feet up the road, got out of the car and made my way to the tread. Traffic was light and when a small gap appeared I made big sweeping hand gestures to tell the person to stop. They did, allowing me to safely pull the tread off the road and onto the shoulder.

A guy in a Mini beeped his horn at me and when I looked he gave me the thumbs up. I waved to him and we went on our respective ways.

Thanks, dude. It's nice to be appreciated for a small good deed, even if it's just a beep and a thumbs up.",0
"Hooked some guys up, got hooked up in return",Very_legitimate,"So I'm just getting home from the bar and had a cool night. I'm walking home from the bar and see this pizza place is still open. So I decide to run in and get a large pizza and some sodas. Way too much for me but fuck it if I'm here I'm going to stock up in my head.

So I'm carrying this big ass pizza and some 2 liters of soda home and get towards my part of town. This neighborhood fucking sucks. It's poor and it's the only part of town I've been robbed in. So I'm kinda nervous for this part of the walk and really on look out for people.

I walk past this house and some guys my age are on the front porch and dude yells something to me but I can't make out what he says, but he keeps calling to me so I walk up to their porch. He asks me some weird questions. Like if I saw someone walking around tonight and I'm just like nah I haven't seen anyone.

I'm drunk as shit and kind of tired of standing so I'm like you all want to eat this pizza with me? They're down so we all kill this massive pizza and I let them have the sodas because I don't want to carry them the rest of the way.

They're pretty stoked on the food haha, telling me they got me later and good looking out. And as I'm saying bye one of them was like you smoke? I said yeah, and dude pulls out a fat blunt and let's me in on it. I've been out of herb for a week now or so, so that was exactly what I wanted to go along with the alcohol.

It was well worth giving them some pizza and drinks! Going and chilling with them made my night so much better haha. 

If you're ever walking through town with a pizza, share it with people and good shit can happen

lady at fast food restaurant couldnt pay for food,fifa7123,"Hi! new to this subreddit, but i think this story fits in!
    Behind the counter is a totally different experience, the way you view people is altered in such a way that it becomes scary. you start to notice things as you spend more time behind the counter. Things from body language and appeal all play a part. In the fast food industry, work is a grind and a half. Everyday becomes the same boring old mess. it just feels like you've been dragged across a sandpaper desert with each passing day and at the end of the month you get a drop of aloe drip as a reward. How does one mange to stay in this type of work?
    I've been working in the fast food industry for awhile now. Just part time work, since I've been focusing on school. The fast food restaurant i work in, is in a run down neighborhood, where gangs/crimes rates are high and the unfortunate lie. Poverty was also a huge problem in that area. i work there because i use to live close by that neighborhood. the people i work with are mostly contract workers looking for a permanent residency, they are the hardest working people you'll ever meet! On one stormy evening, an African lady with a her small child walked into the restaurant. Judging by their muddy worn shoes they've walked a great distance to get here. their dark damped drippy shirts suggested that they walked here through the rain with no umbrella. the child visibly shaking from the ice rain, but the warmth in her eyes as she saw my colleague preparing someone else food was one of hope. my eyes laid on them, they are slim as a stick. kid you not, it looked like they came straight from a UNICEF commercial. the mother proceeded to order by pointing at our holy menu (through their eyes). after they've chosen something from our value menu, the mother reached into her shallow pockets and dug out some qurters, dimes and nickles. the placed them on the counter in front of me with care and asked me if it was enough. it was no where near enough...i felt just as helpless as them because i couldnt do anything to help them. (the restaurant was in a poor neighborhood so its very often for hobos and con artists to invade our location) the longer i stare at the little girl the more it reminds me of my past. other customer were getting anxious and yelling at them to ""get lost"". most of the customers were pretty unhappy with them, except for a few. of those few were a old gentlemen in a cheap grey suit. obviously a man of respect and definition of ""digging yourself out"". its very easy to spot them out after youve worked in the fast food business for awhile. 
    I opened my mouth to turn them away...the old gentlemen suddenly stepped in front of mother-daughter family. he pulled out his compressed folded wallet. He simply said, ""I havent done anything nice today, all i did was sit behind an office all day."" He pulled out more than enough money from his wallet and gave the money to the mother, then said, ""take it. treat yourself and her to a nice meal. if you need more ask me, i'll be sitting over there.""
    The pure euphoria was displayed on the daughters face, as she stood there with an unbreakable smile. the mother barely able to receive the cash without glee and thankfulness. I looked up at the other customers and saw the shadow looks on their faces. A face of defeat and shame ran around the lobby. the old gentlemen proceed to sit down and ate his meal satisfied knowing that it was something that can lift the spirit of that family and give them hope. 
   This small act of kindness was like a contagious disease, more of these were displaced that night as the restaurant was closing. i felt my heart warm up a bit. something that i would least expect when working in this neighborhood. This goes to show that even working in the fast food industry in a run down neighborhood where customers are more likely to mug you than to buy from you, kindness can be appreciated. the old man is like the aloe drip and the work is similar to the sandpaper. These acts of kindness is what makes the people behind the counters day, and its what motivates them them to go through all the pain, just to be part of a situation like this one.
    some could argue that you do it for the money... or for permanent residency...but i believe its something else that keeps them coming back.",0

If a dog can do random acts of kindness...,kinsmed,,0
Better late than never,littleln,"This happened last year, but better late than never. My oldest daughter is high functioning autistic. Last year I was at the Louisville science center with both of my daughters (they were six and three at the time) my older daughter started to have an issue and went into a full blown meltdown. These are pretty ugly, and for her sometimes violent, events. People were staring as I tried to carry (or drag, I'm 4'9"" and she's about 60lbs) her someplace safer and I couldn't manage her and my three year old. Well this nice lady in her 50's or so helped me out by escorting my younger child while I moved my older to a safer area where she could just have her fit.

Well its a year later and I have to say that's the nicest thing a random stranger has ever done for me/us. There was no judgment, she saw I was having trouble and just helped. I wish I could send her a thank you card. I still think of it and someday I'll have the opportunity to pay it forward. I can't wait.",0

Random act of Kindness at Carrows in Santa Rosa,Taxmantbh,"I work at a Carrows in Santa Rosa, CA, which is usually a 24/7 store, but we had to close the doors at 11:00 tonight. I had a man sit down by himself and order a breakfast combo and a chicken quesadilla. We were a little bit busy, so I wasn't able to give him the type of service I would normally want to give, but he was very patient and understanding.

When he left, he charged his card with a very significant tip with a note ""I have a baby due tomorrow. Share the love!"" I ran outside to try to catch him and at least talk to him, but he waved and drove away.
I wasn't able to get a picture of the receipt because my phone is garbage, and my work needed to hold onto the original copy of the receipt.

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I really just want to find him and at the very least say thanks. Because he paid with a card, I know his first and last name, but I really don't want to go sharing it with all of the internet.

Anyway, if you see this, I'm sure you'll know that I'm talking about you, so Thanks! I really appreciate it! You were a wonderful guest, and I would have been very happy to wait on you for no tip! I wish you the best luck with your new (or growing) family!",0
Kind elderly man paid our check without us knowing and disappeared before we had a chance to say thank you.,Ianrchavez,"Title says it all. My girlfriend and I went out for breakfast and when we got to the restaurant we both held open the doors for a man who came and dined alone. This man happily thanked us and walked in and we thought nothing of it.
At the end of our meal, the waitress informed us that somebody had paid for our check. We asked who it was so we could go express our gratitude, only to find out the person had already left. 
The man we held the doors open for was gone, so we assume it was him. 
It felt amazing that a stranger did that for us. The people sitting in the tables around us saw the whole thing and told us to pay it forward, and we definitely will :)

today i felt like a decent human being for the first time in months,hazza270,"I've been fucked up for a long time. Severe depression, anxiety, and alcoholism has caused me to become a horrible, selfish, recluse over the last year and I hate the person I've become.

But today made me feel better about myself.
My little brother came to visit me. I moved away from home for university two years ago and while I've seen him sorta frequently (holidays etc), he's never come to visit me, and I always marked that down to him deep down being a little ashamed of me.

I'm studying Film Production at university, and recently my brother has also gotten into films and film-making. He just made his first film, and throughout the process he asked me for help and advice and it made me feel like I had something worthwhile to add to the world, for the first time in ages.
Today when he came to visit he just wanted to watch films with me. I showed him a selection of films that really inspired me on my film-making journey. I showed him Clerks, Fight Club, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie (we're both fans of ""weird"" comedy), and The Royal Tenenbaums.
He responded really enthusiastically about every film, and I told him everything I knew about every film.

I know this doesn't really count as a random act of kindness, but it was the first thing I've done in a very long time that I felt I did solely to help someone else, since I've spent the last year or so moping and selfishly caring only about myself. I just wanted somewhere to express how good I feel about myself, cos this doesn't happen often :)",0
Nice guy driver helped a pedestrian in a wheelchair,comickat,"Yesterday night, I was sitting at the intersection that blocks the entrance to my neighborhood, waiting to turn left. In the crosswalk intersecting my car's intended turn lane, an older gentleman in a wheelchair was slowly making his way across the street. Behind him was a red car, also waiting for the pedestrian to finish crossing so he could make his own left turn. The old man was clearly having a difficult time. The ""walk"" signal had already replaced the blinking ""don't walk"" signal, and he wasn't even close to being halfway across the street. Suddenly, the red car turned it's hazard lights on, and the young driver jumped out and made his way towards the pedestrian. At this point, the light had already changed, and I was afraid the driver was going to get mad at the poor old gentleman for holding him up. I didn't hear the brief exchange that followed, but instead of getting upset, the driver pushed the pedestrian's wheelchair the rest of the way across the street. He then returned to his car to catch the light.

I just want this random guy's kindness and chivalry to be acknowledged. ",0

Met a kid fighting addiction and helped him go back to rehab.,soapyfork,"This happened on 6/27 and I posted it somewhere else, someone else said I should post it here. I would rather not rewrite it so just keep in mind what the dates are:


I want to share this with you and hopefully get some good responses to share with with the boy that I met yesterday.


On the train ride home I overheard a boy, about my age (20yrs) speaking with a woman about trying to go to a crisis center or rehab center. She was giving him advice but he needed to call ahead to make sure a bed was available. She had to get off of the train and his phone was dead so he was asking around for a phone charger and people were treating him like he was hardly human.


I decided to let him use my phone, under my supervision because he may be a nice kid, but he was still an addict. We spoke for a while and I was amazed by his view of the world.


He told me that he had been clean for a while but the pervious night he had gotten mugged. The guys beat him pretty bad (it was apparent just by looking at him) but he had retaliated by smashing one of his attackers face into the ground. What came out of his mouth next blew me away. He said ""I regret hurting him so much, there was so much blood. He probably needed the money, he is probably as fucked up, if not more fucked up, then me. I wish I would have just given him my money."" After the attack he shot up in an ally after a few months of sobriety.


He went on to tell me how much he hated his addiction, how he hated that he hurt his friends and family. He wanted nothing more than to be clean. Not once did he ask me for money or anything like that. All he did was express gratitude for not being treated like garbage. He told me how much he loved his parents for never giving up on him, even when he would spend months living on the streets, stung out on drugs.


After calling around he ended up finding a few rehab centers that had available beds and he set up some interviews. I took his number and sent him a text this morning to ask how he was doing.


He said that he was preparing for the interviews and was really excited to try to turn things around again. He sent me a very long thank you and promised to keep me updated on his status.


It made me really happy to see him so genuinely express so much gratitude and have the strength to ignore the harsh judgment of the world. He wants to be a better person and I really hope that it works out for him.



EDIT UPDATE 7/1/14:
I have been in pretty decent contact with him and he is officially in the rehab center working to get clean. He will not be having his cell phone but I decided that I would write him so we can still keep in contact. Looks like he is really serious about getting better and has taken the steps to do so. I hope that he can get his life together! I was hoping to be able to gather some positive words to send to him when I write.



EDIT 7/7/14: I sent him a letter and am awaiting a response. Thank you to whoever gave me gold. I appreciate it a lot. Hopefully I can keep up with him and really earn the gold that you gave me :) Gotta figure out how to give people gold in real life :P Friendship will have to do for now.

Chivers RAK a Mile to Their Community,okchive,,0
Here is my first RAK share.,,"I took my youngest daughter to an all you can eat ice cream event today in the city I live in. We took a break and headed to the playground nearby where I took a seat on a bench. Looking over I notice a woman having difficulty putting on a watch. From the looks of it she had MS. I ask her if she would like some help and she said yes. So I went over and helped her with her watch. 


Last night I decided to go solo to a bar. I don't have a close circle of bro's I hang with, but that doesn't stop me. I decide it's time to leave and head out. A gentleman in a wheelchair having difficulty carving through the sea of people meets me halfway. I turn around and start tapping people on the shoulder letting them know to watch their back. He makes it through and finds a spot to chill. 


On the way to my vehicle that night I see a community garden and decide to go up and check out what's growing. There's a bunch of daisies planted at the entrance and I pick one. Carrying it with me to my vehicle I see a memorial of some sorts with flowers and such decorating a tree. At the base is a bottle with nothing in it. That's where the daisy belonged, so that's where I left it.",0
I gave a kid an ice cream,Owz182,"Normally whilst jogging in the park I like to look around and watch all the people enjoy the sunshine. But today I was jogging by and there was a woman with a little boy sitting on the bench. The woman had awesome multicoloured hair and the little boy was small and had glasses. I don't know why but something about the pair of them really endeared them to me. Upon closer inspection I saw their eyes were all puffy and red, the little boy was crying and the woman was consoling him. Now I don't know what their situation was (mother and child?) but I figured some little boy shouldn't be crying on such a lovely evening. I thought he should be happy and eating ice cream like all the other kids, wouldn't it be awesome if someone just went up to them and gave him an ice cream? Just to show whatever is going on, whatever pain he's going through, the world has kindness and there is good out there. That someone may as well be me. So I jogged down the local shop and grabbed him an ice cream, and jogged back (I was scared that they would leave, and I'd have to eat the ice cream knowing it had never fulfilled its destiny). I was also scared that in todays society the lady wouldn't let me give the kid the ice cream in case I was some lunatic or something. Luckily the guys were still there, and were still crying. I said ""Excuse me, but I noticed you were upset earlier so I thought I'd get something for you down the shop"". I handed him the ice cream. The lady was speachless, she just put her hand to her mouth and began to cry anew. I could tell she appreciated the gesture. I said ""I hope that things get better for you soon"", and she gave me a knowing nod. I walked away and to be honest felt brilliant, so my act wasn't completely selfless. To be honest I don't mind if nobody reads this but I was in such a buzz I had to write it down somewhere. The moral of the story, if you think something might be a really nice gesture, do it, it might just make someone's day.  TLDR; A kid was crying with a lady so I got him an ice cream.",0

While walking my dog...,Celeress,"I was walking down the block.. you know, just walking my dog. Nothing really exciting there, and to be honest... this probably won't be the best thing you've ever read or something, I just thought I would share it :)

While walking my dog, a nearby house had a gate on like, the side of their house where the driveway is (if you get the idea) and it was open. I'm just.. casually strolling by with my little white dog on her bright flashy pink leash and harness. All of a sudden, 2 dogs, 1 small white dog like mine just with long hair and a bigger, I guess... medium sized dog..? Dark brown-ish.. Anyways, they come running out with collars on blah blah blah but no leash and no owner. 

At first I'm just thinking.. ""Oh ok, guess someone was playing with their dogs or whatever and then saw my dog and came running over"" except.. the owner was no where to be found. I stood around and waited a little, still nothing. While waiting however.. at the end of the block (maybe.. 7-ish houses down?) a mother (actually the babysitter, the mother arrives shortly after in her car) was playing with 2 really young kids and the dogs came running over curious/excited or whatever. The babysitter is like, swatting the dogs back or something, thinking they're going to eat the kids or something but hey, i'm not complaining, they're not even her kids and shes being really protective so good for her. Anyways.. I'm kind of dragging this out, but still with no owner in sight, still walking my dog, I run over to the dogs which, on seeing me, start running in the opposite direction. The house with the kids outside of it was a corner house so the dogs run across the street (stayed within the cross walk if i might add) I end up having to pick up my dog to run after the other dogs because mine is lazy and doesn't want to run just to catch up. Chasing them for 2 blocks I finally pick the small white 1 up and herd the other 1 back towards their house while dragging mine on her leash. No idea how some of these people walking 4+ dogs or whatever do it.. but here I was with my flashy pink leash walking 1 dog, carrying another, and chasing after a 3rd for 2 blocks back to their house.

After a few weird looks from people etc. I get back to the dogs home. However, they weren't home but it just so happens that their neighbors who talk with them a lot or whatever come home just as I arrive so they watch the dogs until their owners get back. After explaining to the neighbors what happened, they offered me a reward (they mentioned $20) which I declined because either way I probably would have ended up chasing after the dogs or I would of felt terrible knowing some family right across the street from me lost their dogs while I watched them go. So after some ""thank you's"" etc. I walk home and tell my mom what just happened (I'm 15) but karma I guess? Later that same day, my mom comes up to me with $20 and tells me ""Gonna be gone all day tomorrow won't have time to make food etc. etc."" even though I could have made food. It just seemed really weird because my mom is gone all day for work a lot and has never given me money because she wouldn't be home... let alone the same amount of money the neighbors mentioned as a reward that I declined. Well.. thats my story, I just thought it was sort of interesting and thought I would share it.. and sorry for the big post and my terrible story telling! ",0

First impressions can be deceiving.,caffeinatedcaffeine,"This happened a couple months ago. If I'd known about this subreddit, I would've posted it immediately... alas.

So my family and I are in the car trying to cross a bridge. There's a huge pile-up of cars approaching the toll booth and we've been in our appropriate line (choice between cash and ""Fast Trak"", people with those microchip electronic pre-paid things in their cars) for about 5 minutes, slowly creeping up the way. People on either lane to the sides of us are shooting past as they are Fast Trak lanes. As we get closer, about 5 cars away from the toll booth, the car immediately behind us suddenly jerks out of our lane, speeds ahead, and jams themselves back into our lane directly in front of us.

Our car is in an uproar. What a jackass. Schmuck. Jerk. WTF. We're basically cussing this guy out all the way to the toll booth. He pulls in, pulls out, and it's our turn. Still sour, my mom (the driver) holds out her cash to the toll booth guy.

He waves his hand at her. ""Paid for.""

She stares at him blank for a second. ""What?""

""Guy in front of you paid for you. Go.""

She gawks for a second, thanks him, and proceeds through. We are all stunned. The guy we couldn't say enough bad things about paid for us. We still don't know why! Our car has a lot of interesting bumper stickers- maybe he liked one? We tried to catch up with him on the bridge to wave to him, but he was too far ahead to catch up with safely. Suddenly the sour mood is gone and everyone is overjoyed. A random stranger was kind to us for (next to?) no reason. That toll ain't cheap. $6 during commute hour.

The funny thing is, when we were in better financial situation, we used to do the same thing for the cars behind us whenever we crossed a bridge.

Random dude, you'll probably never see this. But thanks. You made our day and reminded us people don't always suck. And I'm sorry about all the names we called you before we knew you were awesome. ",0
Saw this during my coffee run in the AM.,caiteeeelynn,"It's raining in the Midwest, which means traffic and everyone's attitude is a nightmare. I bolt inside my coffee shop this morning to grab and go quickly, but the line was almost out the front door. I then noticed a screaming baby, very very new screaming baby (looked weeks, if not days old). The mother was wrapping up a phone call, I overheard her say something about ""first time without help"" (assuming her partner). She's fumbling around, and tried to get in line, but couldn't get her money together and maintain the crying baby. She brought her purse, baby bag, as well as her baby carrier back to a side table to find her money. 

Just when most people would give nasty looks to a woman with an  out of control screaming baby in a early morning public place, I witnessed something exactly the opposite. The lady who was immediately behind her placed her order, retrieved her coffee, as well as a second, with a small breakfast item (wrapped in paper), and brought it over to the new mom with a hug. 

You could see the sense of relief in her eyes as she started to cry. It's very rare where you see someone in the moment of utter thanks. ",0
The wonderful woman who helped me out when I was stranded at the airport,CeruleanTresses,"Last year, I was flying around interviewing at different graduate schools in strange cities I'd never been to. 

The day I flew to Chicago, everything went wrong. I left my cell phone on the seat of my dad's car when he dropped me off, and didn't notice until it was too late. Then I stupidly put my purse, with all of my money, credit cards, and ID inside, in my carry-on suitcase. The carry-on got checked at the gate because they ran out of room. 

I get off the plane and go to the baggage claim. No suitcase. My garment bag showed up, but more and more time went by and still no suitcase. My mouth went dry as I realized I was stranded in a Chicago airport with no phone, no identification, and no access to money. I'd never been in a situation like this before and had no idea what to do. I didn't know how I was going to check into my hotel room or even get anything to eat.

So I went to the customer service and tearfully told them what had happened. They were absolutely wonderful and busted their asses to get me my bag. But the person that I'll never forget is an older woman who was also at customer service, because they'd lost one of her bags too. Not only did she let me use her cell phone to call my dad and tell him what was going on, she gave me $20 so I could get some food--and then refused to take it back when, miraculously, the bag was finally found. She was incredibly sweet to me the whole time.

She told me to pass it on to someone else when they're in need. I'm still waiting for that moment when a stranger unexpectedly needs $20, but I did end up getting into a grad program and now I set aside ~5% of my stipend every month for charity. I hope she'd be happy if she knew.",0

How a breakfast bill for one person came up to $38...,SunflowerRainbow,"I was having breakfast at a local diner this morning and sat near the cash register. This woman was sitting alone all throughout and she finally came up to pay her bill. It came up to $38. I was wondering how a breakfast for one could cost so much (I had stepped away for a bit to use the rest room). Turns out she paid for this young couple who were counting their pennies on whether they could afford to pay breakfast. She left word with the cashier not to tell them until after she had left. They were so happy that they decided to do the same, but for one person, since they barely had enough to pay for 2.

Not just a free shirt,clicker4721,"I went to a supermarket today to buy a button-down shirt for a job I start next week. I have a couple of gift cards of unknown credit and $14 in my wallet; I also have a $100-bill stashed in my car for special situations, so I'd rather not break it. The shirt, with sales tax, ended up costing $26 and some change, and the two gift cards held $11. Great. Well, I tell the cashier that I'm sorry and that I have some more cash in my car and that I'll be right back; she said she'd keep the shirt with her. I walk out to my car, grab my bill, and get back in line at the register. When I get to her I say, ""Okay, I'm back. I have--"" she interrupted me to tell me that a lady in line behind me had asked if the only thing I was buying was the shirt. When the cashier told her so, the lady bought my shirt! I was caught completely off guard, said thank you, and looked around -- not expecting to see the people in line behind me. I didn't, and just shrugged to the cashier as I walked out.

TL;DR: Stranger bought me a nice shirt.",0
"Long frustrating day, i still tried to do my part. (long story)",unfaze7,"As petty as this might seem my last comment that i had on the AMA earlier today is what started my day going downhill. I mean that AMA was what i was looking forward to since last week, i had set my reminders was even thinking of what question to ask. Sure enough i missed it, i forgot to read all of the info. Then i had asked for a raise because i found out 2 newer employees one of which i trained are getting paid more hourly than i am. I let my manager know that i deserve a raise, i don't think its right that i'm getting paid less, etc etc. He understood and agreed, said he had to run it by HR and that he will before he takes his lunch in a few minutes. Well 30mins went by and by the time he took his lunch our HR lady had already gone home for the day. I knew because she always goes home at 1, everybody knows that. Anyways my work day doesn't get any better but i'm still fighting it trying to make it better.  

Now I had to go to the store to buy a wrist pad. As i pulled into the lot i saw a young kid maybe 19-22 yrs old? He had a sign 'hungry, anything helps' or something like that, i couldn't quite read it because he looked pretty beat. Not beat up but hungry and struggling, he was standing up when he saw me pulling into the lot and after passing him he sat back down. I felt mad, like ""fuck you really going to make me feel bad that i don't have any cash on me."" Then i realized i had maybe $3 dollars in my wallet, so i stopped i looked in my side view mirror, he had his head down then noticed that i hadn't parked i was just in the middle of the parking lot. I rolled down my window and he walked towards my car and that's when i handed him the $3 dollars, he thanked me said god bless you and you could see some happiness in his face. I parked, went into the store still feeling bad, i could see him through the windows him waiting for other passing cars. I found my wrist pad for my desk then noticed some snacks by the register, so i got him some vitamin water, trail mix and a snickers, only if they had better snacks but it was something. I get to my car and see him walking to his bike, which was full of bags and also pretty beat up. I hurried up hoping he wasn't leaving, it was a one way street and looked like he wouldve headed against traffic, wouldn't of matter i wouldve driven around ti'll i found him to give him the snacks. Luckily he didn't go anywhere. As i'm driving towards him i see a white commercial van stop as it was pulling into the lot, the kid walks up to it and around it. I see the driver on his phone just about ending his phone call. I wanted to get the kids attention to give him his snacks but i waited, there were no cars behind me so that was good. Another car pulls up behind the van just as the driver of the van is getting out and walking around. The kid apologizes to the other driver for the hold up, he didn't seem to mind waiting and just smiled. The driver of the van gave the kid maybe 3 bagels or some sort of the bread, he was happy and thankful. As hes walking in front of the other car apologizing again to the other driver for the hold up, the other driver hands the kid some cash as well. He has 3 big pieces of bread, walking to the driver to get the cash and making sure he doesn't drop his bread. He thanks the driver. Now i'm still waiting, I get the kids attention and hand him the bag, I tell him this is for you and to take care man. By now he's overwhelmed, 3 cars back to back to back helping him out, he's stuttering his words as he's thanking me.  

Felt real good and put my bad day in perspective, still though i wanted to do more for him.",0
Anonymous Teacher paid for prom tickets for me and my prom date,TDWfan,"I recently asked my friend to Prom. She, fairly happily, said yes, which was good news for me. She later asked if she needed to pay for her ticket, and I being a gentleman, said no. So I had to pay for her prom ticket and my own. I had gotten a free half a prom ticket earlier for fundraising, but with prom tickets being $65 a pop, I'd need to spend nearly $100 for just the tickets. I wasn't sure how I'd pay for it, as I do not yet have a job and I didn't think my dad would pay for it.

After homeroom today the teacher in charge of my class' fundraising called me in to the hallway. ""I want to make sure you know this, but... you do know that both of your prom tickets are paid for, right?"" She said. I didn't know that.

Apparently some anonymous teacher paid for both of them. No note or anything, not expecting thanks, just out of the kindness given to them. So, I'd like to express my thanks here! Thank you, teacher of mine!",0
A quick thank you to the woman that made an effort to be polite to me today.,TheLastStrawBender,"I don't know if this is the right place for this kind of story or not, but I just wanted to say my thanks. 

I am a 19yo guy that has struggled with depression, anxiety,  and self confidence issues. I never really felt like I have had many friends outside of a select few. I would consider most people to be just acquaintances. Anyways, since I have come to college I have spent the last two years in a rut of depression. I am not a shut in by any means, but I am just the guy that walks down the street and goes unnoticed by most if not all people that walk past. 

Today while I was out buying food at a local store, I was feeling pretty down as I was walking around. I normally try to exude a happy personality, but today wasn't a great day. I don't know if this woman sensed that I wasn't having a great day or if she is just always nice, but as I went up to check out she smiled at me and asked me how I was doing. This is the usual sort of small talk I am used to, but she seemed to ask it differently and in a more caring and genuine way. I mumbled something about feeling sick and proceeded to pack up my groceries. As I was about to leave she asked me if I was sure I felt ok and I just replied with something about having a bad day and feeling down. She then looked at me and said, ""I hope you have a better rest of the day. You seem like a very nice person. I hope you find something that brings you some happiness today.""

I was blown away. I smile instantly lit up my face and I thanked her. I never get attention, compliments or anything other than small talk when out in public. The fact that she took the extra few seconds to make a kind, sincere, and personal statement to me, made my week. Sometimes it's the littlest of gestures that make someone's day. Thank you kind stranger for making a sad guy's day.",0

I hope I made their week,swarexs985,"Well, payday was Friday. Three hundred dollars richer. As a side job,I mow lawns, so I had another sixty. So I went to get gas. I go inside to pay and I'm behind a sharply stressed elderly man. He wants to put three dollars in his truck. I don't know if he's stuck in the sixties, but gas costs more than that for a gallon. On an impulse, I decide to make his day. He exits, and after I pay,I tell the clerk to use my card and fill his tank. In utter disbelief, the lady mutters a ""wow"". Apparently this isn't very common. 

I leave the building, and see his face. Utter. Disbelief. The gas tank didn't trickle-stop at $3. I stayed back and watched as he pumped what was probably $50 in to the truck that looked about as old as he was. I don't know if he walked in to ask the lady what gives, or thanked God for the pump malfunction, but I gave that sharply dressed old man (whose clothes and truck were probably all he had left) a full tank. 

It's not much, but I know there's been more than once that I've wished I could put a couple more dollars in my tank. I hope I gave him enough to get wherever he was going.

The $20 Backpack Project: Our first assembly. (xpost from /r/homeless),bubonis,"[Imgur gallery.](http://imgur.com/a/YxzBX#0)

About a month ago I found, via reddit, a YouTube video demonstrating the [$20 Homeless Backpack Care Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6fkyf9UGAE) on YouTube. I was inspired by this video for many reasons. Of course, I enjoy helping when I can, but I also want my daughter (currently six years old) to have a better appreciation for not only the things she has, but also to understand that helping people in need is just as important as helping yourself. So I made it a project to duplicate this effort, or come as close to it as I possibly could.

After examining the video a few times, and particularly paying attention to the screen shot of their Excel spreadsheet to build a shopping list, I was ready to go. I sat down with my daughter and told her what the plan was. She had a few questions, mainly dealing with the issue of homelessness. We are fortunate to live in an area where that's not an ""immediately visible"" problem so the concept of seeing someone sleeping on the street because they have nowhere else to go is pretty alien to her. So we talked for awhile, I showed her some YouTube videos, and gave her some examples. She was quick to catch on and, like me, wanted to help.

So, on a rainy Saturday I went shopping with the intention of creating four backpacks. My wife had errands to run with my daughter so I went shopping without her. My first stop was the local consignment store where I found three full-size backpacks for $5 each. While these were more expensive than the $2 backpacks shown in the YouTube video, I opted to forego the beanie, scarf, and gloves since winter was (finally) over and the weather is warming up. Removing these items freed up $4 per pack from the original budget so I felt it was a good enough trade. When the weather starts cooling down again I'll revisit this.

So, with my plans reset for just three backpacks, the next stop was the local dollar store. There's a Dollar Tree near my house so I was able to mirror a lot of the purchases from the YouTube identically, down to the brand. Things like toilet paper, bar soap, and peanut butter were the same brands and sizes available at my Dollar Tree which made my life a lot easier. There were some last-minute substitutions; for example, the backpacks in the YouTube video had apple sauce and a fruit cup to his packs, but my Dollar Tree didn't have any fruit cups so instead I opted for one cup of plain apple sauce and one cup of strawberry apple sauce.

I also wanted to add a few things to my packs, things that I felt would not only be helpful but also possibly improve the morale of those who would be getting them. In the helpful category I also included small bottles of shampoo and mouthwash as well as a hair brush (in addition to a comb which was also on the YouTube video list). I added some extras in the food category too, including a pouch of tuna, a box of YooHoo, and a cup of ramen noodles. And even though the video suggests not giving things which are high in sugar content, I felt that a small bag of jelly beans wouldn't be too bad, and while I was in the candy aisle I also threw in two rolls of Certs (one fruit, one spearmint). As incidentals, I added a small first aid kit, a crossword puzzle book, pencils, pens, and a note pad as I felt these would be helpful in not only passing the time but also for just everyday life. And finally, although I fundamentally have a disagreement about smoking in general, I felt that a lighter would be very helpful as a simple survival tool; the ability to easily create a fire to keep warm on cold nights seems vital to me.

Purchases made, I headed home to where my daughter was waiting for me. We spent about 20 minutes putting the backpacks together and had a lot of fun doing it. She came up with the idea of putting the toilet paper in one of the plastic bags to keep them dry, which I thought was brilliant (especially for a six year old). We weren't able to add the rain poncho or the emergency blanket; the Dollar Tree had neither and the local businesses wanted too much money for them. So I went to Amazon and found suitably priced items and used my Amazon Prime account to ship them. I ordered Saturday night; they arrived Monday. We added those to the packs on Monday evening.

Another small hitch was the first aid kit that I decided to include in every bag. The Dollar Tree only had two on the shelf so I grabbed those. I built a third kit from supplies I already had in the house, sealing it in a small Glad container (which I already had) and put that into the third backpack.

And... That's it. Right now all three backpacks are in the trunk of my car. On the weekend (the only days where we have time) my daughter and I will head out to a local shelter and she will pick out three people who will get the backpacks. I'm not quite sure how this will go over but I'm taking it as a learning experience. For both of us.",0
What goes around comes around,trololady,"A while back I had paid for the person behind me at a Starbucks drive-thru, mainly because I had some extra cash and thought I could make someone's day just a little bit better.

Fast forward a couple weeks later, and I'm in the drive-thru but running a little late, so I'm getting impatient with the person in front of me taking a while. Turns out she was paying for my drink and food with her birthday gift and wanted to share the wealth. 

Needless to say I was little embarrassed for getting cranky when she was just trying to help. :)",0

Casual acquaintance reached out to help me.,religiousnephew,"**[Trigger warning: self-harm]**

I've struggled with self-harm in the past, and been dealing with depression for some time now. I had gone a while without cutting, but something triggered me and I ended up relapsing. I told my friends about it the next day (they're pretty much my only source of support at this point) and I didn't realize it at the time, but a girl I'll refer to as K, overheard us talking about it.

I didn't go to school the next day, and afterwards my friend C came over to make sure I was okay. He told me he had something for me, and took a bag out of his backpack. He told me K had given it to him and told him to bring it to me. I didn't open it right then, as I wasn't sure what it was. So C and I hung out for a while, and after he left I grabbed the bag and started to empty the contents onto my bed.

Inside the bag, I found non-stick bandage pads, a roll of gauze, transparent skin tape, and antibiotic cream. All brand new, hospital-grade medical supplies. I broke out in tears instantly.

The next time I see her I'm going to run up to her and hug her tightly and thank her for this, it is by far the most compassionate thing anyone has ever done for me. She went out of her way to do something incredibly caring for someone she hardly knows.",0
A total of seven total strangers helped me find my dogs.,,"The gate at my house is faulty, and today my dogs managed to bust it open.

It turns out that while they were out, those two troublemakers (I love them with all my heart) made it to a 3 line parkway, a pretty major street where I live. People were good though, instead of just hitting my dogs or ignoring it, 2 women took the time out of their day to shepherd my shepherds back into the neighborhood, and while they didn't catch them (too quick), they did come to my door, but by the time I got to it, they were leaving :( Wish I'd gotten to thank them.

About 30min to 1hr later, a man comes to my door and tells me that he saw two dogs! One of them had gotten back in the gate and the man had closed it behind them. He'd actually followed them for four blocks in his car and waited for them to go in! He really caught the first for me! And he also alerted me to the problem, since I thought they were still in the backyard until then!

After that I went out searching. My dogs are sisters and hate separation, so I took the one I had on a leash to help me look. While I was out, a mom and her daughter came across me. I asked if they'd seen a dog, and they said yes and actually pointed towards where. Within 30 seconds, I'd seen the dog and was running full sprint towards her. The dog had darted out of view because of a loud noise from construction, and a woman had pulled her car over and waited a just to show me where my dog had gone. then, as I went the other direction, an intense runner who I've noticed but never met stopped his workout (I've never seen him do that before) to wait and show me where the dog went again. 

As I got to my pup's location, the mom and her daughter were back, and they were with my dog and had her safe! Turns out they'd spent all the time since seeing me looking for my dog to make sure she got home safe, and they succeeded.

I live in on a semi major street with two pretty big ones on either side of me. The dogs getting out on their own is scary, but a total of seven total strangers took detours and time out of their days to help me get both of them home safe. Now, they're sleeping smugly five feet from me. ",0
A Few Good People,rogonag,"On March 26 I took the bus in Downtown Seattle suddenly the driver hit the brakes and everyone on the bus flew forward. One man sitting in the very back of the bus in the center had nothing to stop him and went flying out of his seat and all the way to the back door of the bus slamming his face onto a couple of metal poles. A few nearby people showed immediate concern and went to help him; there was a man that tried to help the injured man wipe blood off his face, the other passengers yelled for the driver to stop the bus because there was an injured man. As soon as the bus stopped the driver opened all the doors and most of the people in the back of the bus piled out stepping over the injured man not even bothering to look at him. Within a short time the only passengers left on the bus were four people that showed concern. After the ambulance arrived and the paramedics got on the bus the man that tried to help with the tissue made sure to let them know about the injured man’s possessions so they wouldn’t get left behind in the bus, after making sure that things were all right he went on his way. After the paramedics left with the injured man the other passengers got off the bus. It was really nice to see these people show so much concern and stay with this total stranger until he got help. I understand that so many people might not have time to wait around but it’s sad to not even see a look of concern on most of their faces.",0

Helping out in the cold,adeason,"I was just driving, saw a man near my age (30) that was fully equipped with a nice pack and gear. It reminded me of my friend who is biking from Tennessee to California currently at SXSW. The man was carrying a dog at his chest wrapped in a cocoon like warp. A cute dog probably a year old. Its sad to say seeing the dog is what brings my attention to want to help. At first I assume he is well equipped it seems as though he is on a mission and not just without a home. So I turn around and pull over and get his attention to come over. I ask if I can help out and he comes over saying any help would be thanked. I first handed all the cash I had which was only like 20 bucks and than ask if hed like a jacket, flashlight, ibuprofen, or any other firstaid? He said he was well stocked on equipment but a ride a mile up the rode to walmart would help alot. I told him I actually couldnt, I was going the other way. I wish I could give him that ride but I cant risk what I have. I love this world and all of species we have, we are all one made of the same chemistry. We are the universe admiring itself. I love you.",0
Saved the lives of 3 teenagers after taking a back way home.,,"When I was 22 I was on my way home from work and decided to take a back road home instead of my usual route. This back road lead to a country dirt road lined with orange grove the last third of the way so I usually avoided it as it was often very rough. Anyway, as I got to the dirt road part of the trip, I saw an SUV upside down and leaning against an orange tree. The wheels were still spinning so I knew it must have been recent and I slowed down enough that I could jump out of the car as it was still in motion without being hurt.

When I got to the SUV, the doors were locked and I had to kick in the window of one of the doors. I saw 3 people, a girl and 2 boys, no older than 15, unconscious and upside down. I turned off the engine and ran back to my car to get a pocket knife I kept in the glove compartment and ran back to the SUV. Cutting the 2 boys free and lowering them down as easily as I could, I pulled them out of the vehicle. Thankfully the boys were breathing but I had to do rescue breathing for the girl. It was a scary time until she started breathing, but she sat up coughing and was clearly scared to death. 

The boys came to shortly after and by that time a Mail truck had come by and stopped to see if everyone was okay. He called 911 and in the meantime, one of the boys was trying to get up to walk home. I was able to keep him there until the ambulance arrived to take the three of them to get checked out. I later found out that they had been joyriding.

"Giving daily compliments- my resolution, still going strong!",beautifulsouth00,"Hi RAK!  Just wanted to share with you that my personal New Year's Resolution, to give a compliment to someone daily, is still going strong!

Too often people go feeling unappreciated, at work and at home. And when we get feedback, usually at work, it is almost always of the negative variety.  I'm a nurse and feel it acutely, and often say that just one compliment every once in a while will keep me going, give me fuel, etc.   So, I decided for my New Year's Resolution, that instead of stopping something to improve myself, I'd have an active goal of DOING something, and that something has been to give a compliment, or some positive feedback to someone, once a day.  Let me tell you- I am ABSOLUTELY getting something out of this, and I have had no problem with continuing.  I'll give you some examples- I drove a friend to surgery this week and waited for her, then complimented the secretary on her perfect telephone etiquette, and got a customer comment card and the names of all of the staff members who were great during the stay, and mailed that in the next day.  I told fast food workers they were doing a good job, left a Yelp review for my local 7-11 (which is the cleanest 7-11 ever, and the manager asked me to please Yelp my compliments after I made sure to tell her) and bought a candybar for the grocery store cashier who said she was hungry as I checked out.  It's these little things- sometimes they make all the difference!  Even if you just tell a stranger they are rockin' that outfit, it makes two people feel good.  ",0
"It's sad that the concept of ""random kindness"" is hard to grasp for some people. My humorous (and kinda sad) attempt at kindness inside.",Zinbadd,"So it's Friday, and I'm having a bad bad day. Like one of those, beating on the dashboard screaming at whichever deity comes to mind kinda days.


I decided that I needed some Starbucks. Man, I love coffee. I also love doing random shit for people, because it's fun. 


So I meander into Starbucks and I order my coffee. I purchase two gift cards, each $5. 


I write on them the following message: 

**dear stranger, enjoy your Starbucks on me today. Pay it forward if and when you can. Have a good day!**


Then I awkwardly loiter outside, waiting on my ""victims.""


A lady walks up, and I say hi. She ignored me and walks in. Okidoke, somebody doesn't like casual conversation. I wait longer. A second woman comes up, and I decide conversation isn't my best choice. I walk up to her and try to just hand her the card. She stops, looks at it, and says something like ""I cannot imagine Starbucks would appreciate you passing out your dumb pamphlets outside their store."" She huffs off, and next thing I know...a manager is coming out...telling me I need to leave. I explain what I'm doing, she laughs and apologizes.


I was told by 7 customers to leave. 

**seven.**


I started laughing. 


No free coffee for them, I guess. They didn't even stick around long enough to let me explain or give it to them.


It was a clearly marked Starbucks envelope with their logo plain as day. 


Finally, I found two people who took the cards. They read them, smiled, and said thanks. It made me feel better, but I was astonished that it took some 10 people and 40 minutes to be able to buy somebody a damn coffee.


Anyway, I felt better after that.

I'd like to continue the trend and ""remind"" people with a card like his.  Is there somewhere anyone knows of that I can get these cards, or did he make these on his own?",0

"[STICKY] Please read the rules before posting, requests NOT allowed!",imnotlegolas,"I had to remake this post again, because we've seen an increase in requests coming in lately. 

This topic is more for the mobile users, because they often don't have a side-bar where they can read the rules. And mistakes can be made, but we try and keep the subreddit as clean as possible. 

It would help a lot of people help us out and downvote accordingly. The downvote is not a punishment for the poster, but it just keeps the frontpage clean. 

**These are the subreddit's rules:**

> **Any posts violating these rules will be removed.**

> * Read the [Reddiquette.](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)
>* [Tags] are not permitted.
>* Personal requests are not permitted.
>* Don't offer things. Go to /r/RandomKindness for that. 
>* We don't allow posts that ask for others to go do a RaoK. 
>* No links to Facebook projects or similar charity/helping projects allowed. 
>* Kickstarter (or similar site) projects not allowed.
>* Charity posts not allowed. There are better fitted subreddits (and bigger ones!) for this purpose.

>* We do NOT tolerate negative comments about the OP or anyone. 

>**If you feel like your submission would not inspire others or bring a positive mood, do not submit it.**

This might seem very strict but this is because there are a lot of subreddits, and many of them involve acts of kindness. 

Especially people asking for things (be it material or digital) come by here often, when they are actually looking for /r/RandomKindness, which is specialized in doing requests and offers. They are way bigger than we are, and thus your request will receive more views.

Each subreddit has their own theme going on, and ours is having posts of acts of kindness stories, that have been done by you or someone else you know. Or even a cross post from another subreddit is allowed, or article you read somewhere.  

Thank you. ",0
Thanks to the Knights in shining armor came to my rescue,essitam,"I am well aware of how unlikely it is they'll see this but I'm so thankful to the 2 men that came to my rescue last night.

Driving home from work, dark wet and windy, which is par for the course in the UK at the moment and all the warning lights flash up on the dash, I think ohhh shit, best get off this main road and I see a petrol station ahead so I indicate to go towards it pulling into the filter lane to wait to cross the traffic and the car losses all power, I'd got nothing, couldn't even turn it over no lights, nothing. Cars passing me on both sides I couldn't do anything but hit the hazards, wait for a gap and leave it abandoned in the middle of the junction to get on the pavement to relative safety.

I get across the road and I'm just about to call recovery when 2 men approach from different directions both offering assistance,  they get some history and try to get me started again but no such luck so they stood in the road stopping all the traffic in rush hour  so they can then push me to safety where they popped the bonnet and again tried to diagnose the problem. They didn't succeed and I had to call recovery anyway but they were brilliant! 

They made sure I was safe, that the car was secure and helped me find the address to give the AA so the recovery guys could find me quickly! I was so grateful to these strangers who spent 30 minutes in the cold and wet to help me when I was in need. 

So if you stopped to help a stranded lady on your way through Birmingham UK last night, thank you, thank very much indeed.

TLDR: Broke down in rush hour traffic, 2 guys went above and beyond to help me out.

Ps. I started paying it forward today, I trained into work (car is properly broke) and bought the homeless guy in the underpass tea and biscuits. No one should be out on the streets. Let alone in this weather it was the least I could do!",0

I'm looking to make this a great birthday and a great day for others! Thank you.

Edit:

This is what I'm thinking now. We can do some things 22 times and other things once at random. Current list:

* 22 baggies for the homeless
* 22 inspirational letters (www.moreloveletters.com)
* 22 sticky notes on bathroom mirrors throughout the city
* pay for coffee for the car behind us
* go for a long hike and pick up trash near the trail
* give out 22 flowers to people in the hospital (who haven't had visitors)
* buy packages of toys to hand out to children (maybe at DMV or somewhere they have to wait)
* give out coffee and gloves to cold homeless with signs *and socks!* (thanks to /u/MeShellG)
* volunteer at the local women's shelter
* leave microwave popcorn on Redbox machines
* bake goods for our neighbors (three families that live very close to us)
* leave quarters in gumball/vending machines (thanks to /u/emeraldgoddess)
* top up parking meters downtown
* possibly give blood - I'll have to check with my roommate on that
* pay for an older couple's meal
* write ""Thank You"" notes to local non-profits
* leave a few good books with notes in coffee shops
* write ""Thank You"" cards to troops (http://www.amillionthanks.org/)
* find and donate to a local food bank
* leave a ""Thank You"" note for our mail carrier
* leave a 50% tip

Stuck at office overnight in Alabama due to the after effects of this winter storm when..,indiechickblue,"One of our IT gentlemen (and a couple others - have to give credit), who was not working at our location during this storm, shows up with his 4WD truck to traverse the hill that leads to our office (we have been stuck here about 30 hours because that hill had been too iced over to get down to the bottom). 

This kind guy explained to me that he waited 3 hours to get the short distance from the store to our office. I was just appreciative of his desire to help out and so I gave him a polite but gracious hug. 

I came to know later that these gentlemen had been handing out water and petty food to these poor souls stranded outside, many of which were outside over night in below freezing temperatures, on their way here. He spent circa $1,000 of his own POCKET money to do all of this, including feeding us. Just...WHOA. I cried, the end.",0

I'm looking to do a guerrilla ""random acts of kindness"" spree on campus (being a recognized organization can't happen til 2015, and would make it less meaningful). I am limited in what I or anyone that helps me can do. These limitations include:

- Not being able to put anything on bathroom mirrors

Did something nice for someone and then someone did something nice for me,Very_legitimate,"My resolution for 2014 is to just do nice shit for people whenever I can. Well I went to the bar tonight (which is an easy place to do nice stuff for stangers) and met this kid just hanging out there. We talked a bit and I tried to buy him a drink but he said he couldn't take one because he was only 18. So Im like ""why the fuck are you at a bar if you can't drink?""

Apparently they let this guy in because they're open later than a lot of other places in town and they know he doesn't have anywhere else to stay and it's cold as fuck out.

I had to leave early but I gave the guy my phone number and address and told him if he ever needs a place to stay or something to eat or just needs to bum a few smokes to hit me up. 

So then I leave on my 30 fucking minute long walk home in like 10 degree weather (which is cold as fuck for here) and this car pulls up beside me and it's this guy I used to work with asking me if I need a ride. So fuck yeah I need a ride, so I hop in and we get to talk a bit while he gives me a lift.

Goddamn being in the cold fucking sucks. I shouldn't have to be out in it, and nobody else should either. I just thought it was kinda funny how I gave this guy my details to get him out of the cold and then later in the night I'm facing the shit myself and somebody bails me out.

and for anyone wondering about the homeless guy. I gave him $40 to grab a room at this cheap nearby motel for the night since he told me he just became homeless and I figured he'd probably want some time alone. He already called me and said he will come by tomorrow to chill and thanked me a lot and it feels fucking awesome. I'm kinda scared though because I've never taken anyone in before. But I'm a lot bigger than he is if he tries some shit and I don't have anything too nice that he could steal that I can't keep in my pockets. Plus I know who he is so it would be counterproductive to fuck me over.

And I think he's a good dude just stuck with shitty circumstances. I was homeless in this town once and the resources here are shit. The city does nothing to keep people off the streets unless they have little kids with them. Shit fucking sucks bad. especially during winter.

Super stoked though on getting to do something nice again for someone and figured I'd share with you all because I hate mentioning good deeds to friends or family. I don't want to look like I'm trying to brag.. albeit that's what I'm sorta doing but just because I feel like I'm finally getting to give back to my city and that shit feels cool",0

What is something that has happened to you that made you realize there are still good people in this world?,seth5208,"Well today my wife and i are grocery shopping like our usual Friday night, and we are walking to a check out line with our full cart. When we get to the line to go to the register we meet head on with a guy carrying a gallon of tea as his only item. he asks ""do you want to go ahead?"" so, of course i tell the man ""No, you go ahead you only have one item."" So he checks out goes on his way then while the cashier is swiping all of our items she randomly asks ""did you know the guy in front of you in line?"" and i didnt so i said ""no i did not."" i never thought anything of it until the cashier said that he had left $20 to apply to our grocery bill. Which stunned my wife and i not because we needed the money or anything, just happy that a random person did something very nice for a stranger that he will probably never see again.

"Random act of giving from three years ago, received an update today.",CaptainMobius,"I've been playing guitar for over twenty years now, and as almost every other guitarist has, I've occasionally suffered from G.A.S. (Gear Acquisition Syndrome). Because of that, I ended up with (gasp!) too many guitars, and a little over three years ago, I decided to part with three guitars that I simply never played - an SX Liquid (http://www.rondomusic.com/liquidfmnr3ts.html), a Musicvox Spaceranger (http://musicvox.com/products/musicvox-spaceranger-guitar.html), and an Epiphone Les Paul (http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/epiphone-les-paul-studio-electric-guitar/518351). But instead of selling them, I decided to do something a little different.

I manage a self storage facility, and one of my tenants gives guitar lessons for a living. I told him that I wanted to give him three guitars, but there was a condition to it: he had to give them as Christmas gifts to three of his neediest students who could not afford to buy a guitar of their own. He agreed, and all three guitars made their way into the hands of some very needy kids.

He came into the office this morning to give me an update on one of them. He gave the Musicvox Spaceranger to a kid from a really poor family who had terribly low self-esteem. The kid has become a very good guitarist, which has increased his self-esteem by leaps and bounds. He formed a band. He met a girl after a show his band played, and they've now been together for a couple of years. She convinced him to apply to college, which he'd never even considered. He got accepted to UCLA, and enrolled this last fall. And he's considering asking the girl to marry him after he graduates.

This totally made my day, and I'm still smiling thinking about how a (for me) simple gift ended up making such a huge difference in someone's life.",0

Almost 6 years ago somebody gave me $20,Very_legitimate,"Figured I'd post this since I was in the sub anyway. Sorta weird because it was almost 6 years ago, but I never mentioned it to anyone and still wonder about it.

5 1/2 years ago I moved to KY to live in a town with my best friend and was working at this grocery store. I didn't really know anyone in town but my friend and a few of his friends, but we were all 18 and broke as shit, so I don't think it was them. Plus most people didn't even know where I worked at this point.

I was struggling though. I had moved out at 18 with no planning whatsoever. So lunch break was me just chilling out in the back room and maybe drinking a soda. But this one day, I go to tell my manager I'm clocking out for lunch and she says something like ""alright, but by the way someone dropped this off for you earlier"" and she hands me an envelope. All it had in it was $20. No note or anything that could give me an idea who it was.

I still think about it and wonder who the fuck could've possibly knew me well enough or cared enough to give me money like that. I spent $5 on a bit of weed, $7.50 in gas, and spent the rest on lunch that week just because that's what I think the money was meant for (I remember not buying cigs because it would've felt wrong haha).

I probably didn't spend it ""right"", as far as how whoever gave it to me intended, since I got herb with it. But I had a lot of fun with that $20

Kinda hate the fact that I'm never going to know who gave me that money. I've ran over it in my head for years now and there really isn't ANYBODY who was in town who cared about me that would've had the money to give away. As far as I know, anyway, but I guess someone cared more than I knew, and thanks to whoever that was. Doubt they read reddit, letalone read this small sub, or could even put the pieces together from my description. But I still think about that $20",0
Got my friend $150 worth of groceries just because it's 2014,Very_legitimate,"My friend came over the other day to sell me some stuff because he recently lost his job and is trying to hold onto his apartment. So I buy it and we're hanging out and he starts talking about his bills and how much everything costs. 

My fridge just broke, but thank fucking god my mom lives nearby and she's willing to have me over every day to eat, so I've been actually saving on money not buying my own food. I usually spend $200/month on food but since I'm not right now, I figured I'd offer to take him grocery shopping since that money I had is just extra money right now.

So I got to hook somebody up with $150 in groceries, and still have an extra $50. Mom just loves the fact I come over to eat, but I'm gonna try to give her a bit of it. But I'm still going to have $25ish extra this month.

Thought I'd share with you all because I love hearing about people doing cool stuff for other people on here, and thought this is my chance to add. I never get to do  shit like this and I'm usually on the receiving end of random 
acts of kindness. It feels really fucking cool

edit-

And sorry if this sounds like a bragging sort of post. Not exactly what I was going for but I guess it sort of was at the same time. I don't really want to put my friend on the spot by telling other friends about it, my parents would flip out if I told them about it, and telling people in person in general would just feel odd and seem like I'm just trying to brag about myself and I don't like that. But I wanted to tell someone and this seemed like the only appropriate sub ",0

Family First.,,"So recently I've been having a lot of emotional issues, some related to my job trying to screw me out of as much money as possible. It's only a part time, store job but not having money is not having money, especially when I'm a Uni student who are notoriously poor to begin with. My mum was aware of this, and decided to do something about it. We have an upcoming family holiday that I've paid for, cost $2,500 and that left me even broker than before and I've been trying to save spending money for while I'm away but the cost of living is almost more than what I'm getting paid. I've managed to save $500 in the last 8 or so months, to give you an idea. So knowing all this, tonight my mum came into my room and handed me a jar saying that she'd been putting coins in it for a while and that I could have it for the holiday. I opened it up after she'd left the room and there wasn't just coins. Overall there was $750 in a mixture of coins and notes. I know that it doesn't sound like a lot of money, but we are by no means a family that has $750 laying around to hand off at will and I know that she has to have put in a lot of effort and thought into cutting back where ever she can to do this for me. I'm almost in tears because I'm just so happy that she would do this for me. 

I know it isn't really a random act, but it was still pretty overly kind.

tl;dr my mum who doesn't have much money gave me more than she could probably afford because I was having even worse money issues. ",0

He turned around, kinda freaked out, like I was about to tell him off or something. Told him, ""It's way too cold to be out here without something warm,"" and gave him the steamy beverage and a fistful of sugar packets.

Random Acts of Christmas Kindness for the 25 Days of the Advent Calendar (Collected Posts),mattyparanoid,"My wife had the great idea of doing a Random Act of Christmas Kindness (RACK) with each day of the advent calendar.

See Post #1: http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1rukwj/advent_calendar_random_act_of_christmas_kindness/

We have cards that go along with the random act of kindness: See my son holding them here on day 1:

http://i.imgur.com/u0t3njA.jpg

Initially I was making a post each day, but that presented some issues. I am now going to post the remainder in this album:

http://imgur.com/a/zTTDh

I will add to this post as we move through the remaining days.

Edit #1: Consolidation and Album done. My last individual post was RACK 12 and truth be told I received a comment that bummed me out. I should be better at dealing with negativity on reddit I know, but it affected me none the less. That said, we continued but I did not post 13, 14, or 15.

Then I got a message this morning from the moderator and I decided to chin up and get posting them again. 

Edit #2: Added links to each days RACK photo.

RACK 13 saw my lovely wife surprising her co-teacher by paying for her dinner at the faculty Christmas party.

RACK 14 we decided to donate to Meals on Wheels

RACK 16 we left the garbage men a bag of candy/card

http://i.imgur.com/Lev1E2r.png

RACK 17 saw us sticking with a tactic we like to call the shotgun blast as we placed quarters for the kids (or young at heart) on the claw and gumball machines at Steak and Shake. Decided we might want to ask permission as we were well within view of the register. This is for every time I begged my Mom for a quarter!

http://i.imgur.com/7ARTEZ7.jpg

RACK 18 Posted late because life gets in the way of doing good. My wife and I grabbed a handful of these cards with a Hershey's kiss attached and taped them to the monitors of folks at our respective workplaces. At the moment of posting I am waiting to hear the scuttlebut around the watercooler about the somewhat random act of semi-planned kindness!

http://i.imgur.com/nYwimdJ.jpg

RACK 19, again posted a day late....My sons wanted to revisit helping folks out with carts at the grocery store, so for this one they asked a few folks if they could take the cart to the cart return for them....Hope it sticks with them.

http://i.imgur.com/sA4Ef67.png

RACK 20, out Christmas shopping and we decided to buy a bag from www.askate.org a group that supports Autism. Skating with Kids through Acceptance, Therapy, and Education. A subject that is near and dear to our family.

http://i.imgur.com/Pb2oxHW.png

RACK 21, If you have sons around my age, you might understand they have limited imaginations for things that are not related to Minecraft. With that in mind, yes this is the third time we are picking up shopping carts. I will say that there was a different slant to each time. This time we returned all the carts from the far side of the Target parking lot. It took quite some time and I am sure we made some Target employee's closing a little bit easier.

http://i.imgur.com/QyjrFEt.png

RACK 22, Different Target, different day. We were getting some wrapping paper (10% off, woot!) and gave the extremely frazzled cashier a card with a $5 Starbucks giftcard attached. I tease in the comments on Instagram, but she was thankful and had what I am sure was a long, crappy day.

http://i.imgur.com/P1YPyp9.png

RACK 23, Family is already at the beach waiting on me to finish work and they decided to hit up the car wash and leave someone a free car wash. Should be nice, especially for the folks like me that always get there and realize they do not have any cash or change. Clean Cars for Christmas!

http://i.imgur.com/LzbgZR0.png

RACK 24 was kids choice and our two sons really liked buying the food for the person behind us in the drive through line. Third time doing this in three weeks and it never gets old for them. They like to watch the person's reaction. Our friends always want to know what and how much we paid for...

http://i.imgur.com/MzUhPU5.png

RACK 25 we struggled with because we wanted to do something personal for someone (or group) that were working on Christmas. Each time we thought of a group, we quickly came up with a reason it wouldn't work. After much thinking we went to a small, local nursing home and brought donuts to the nurses/caregivers on staff. It was perfect and we hope the donuts made their day a bit better.

Looking forward to next year, but planning on continuing throughout the year with our semi-planned, not completely random acts of kindness that make us feel good inside.

Merry Christmas!

My youngest (who has Asperger's) chose to write to the librarian who had directed the ""morning show"" and made him the weather man.

Text follows, sweet, sweet boy when he wants to be!

Dear Ms. Kennedy,

My family is practicing 25 Random Acts of Christmas Kindness. We decided to write letters to teachers who made a difference in our lives. I chose you because you gave me a shot at being on the morning show. The year before I had tried to get onto chorus but they wouldn't let me on because I don't look people in the eye, I wanted to be on safety patrol but I couldn't make it case of behavior indicators. You gave me a chance and it meant a lot to me. The morning show made me a lot more popular. I loved every minute of it. I heard it was hard to get on the morning show but after I got in, it started everything. I loved all the attention and the popularity. It made me feel important. I thank you a lot for letting me on. I hope that I get good grades and use what you taught me for later in life.

From,

Day 8 and finally we all agree on one that doesn't involve money. We live on a golf course and collected golf balls from our yard all year. Rather than clean and sell them on ebay we opted to put a box of them on the cart path and let the golfers take them back.

They have been busily searching the box all morning as they come down the 7th fairway.

Day 6 saw my sons start to lose the intensity as the draw of the Xbox on a Friday night lured them into indifference. Undeterred my wife and I drug them to the local Dollar Store where we each chose an item we thought someone might like help buying. I chose a ninja toy because, Ninjas. My youngest chose diapers because he thought a young mother might need help buying them (thoughtful, I was impressed). My oldest chose a paddle toy because he wanted to hurry and get back home to the Xbox. I did not see what my wife chose as I was making my way back out of the store and I was tired from an 11 hour day and have to ride 3 hours in the morning for an all day class but I digress...

Weary from a long day at work and lacking my wife for idea input as well as my youngest son due to not feeling well; my oldest son and I were on our own for this one.

I opted for leaving cash in library books at the local library. We inserted the RACK card and a post it note along with a small amount of cash in 4 library books just before the library closed.

As we were leaving we realized we should have put the year on the card as it may be a while before they are found. All part of the fun!

Kind professor changed my life,phil8248,When I was applying to physician assistant school I either needed a bachelors degree or I needed to take 25 hours of religion classes in one Summer semester.  I'd worked so hard to get my prerequisites but I didn't realize that since the university that my physician assistant program was at was a school associated with a major denomination I needed to meet their undergraduate core curriculum.  I had one chance.  I'd attended college 15 years before but never finished my senior thesis for my bachelors degree.  I contacted my adviser who had risen in authority within the Arts and Sciences department and told him my story.  I'd earned 27 hours of prerequisites and gotten accepted to PA school but I needed to finish my thesis to avoid taking all these religion classes.  In reality I'd have needed to wait a year because I could never have done them in a Summer.  Also there was the financial considerations too.  My other courses were at a state university with low tuition.  These would be at this private school with a much higher tuition.  It was a nightmare unless I could finish my first degree from his school.  He asked me to fax him my transcripts from the night school classes.  He then called me back and said he'd talked it over with the dean and they were going to just add enough credit hours from my night school and give me a generic degree so I could avoid the religion classes!  To this day it was the kindest thing I think anyone has ever done for me.,0

Secret dinner Santa,MoistVirginia,"Tonight I ate at my local greasy spoon with my boyfriend. We were enjoying our food when a table of sweet looking old folks came in and sat across the aisle from us. It was two men and a woman, and they just looked like the type of people you'd love to have as grandparents. I have a soft side for people like this, because all of my grandparents passed when I was very young.

They joined hands and prayed over their chili and double decker sandwiches, and even though I'm an atheist, I thought their dedication was touching (who prays over a greasy spoon dinner?). I knew I had to buy their meal. 

I caught the server as she was taking them their check and told her I'd be taking care of it. I took it up to the cashier with my own check and then left without saying a word. I can only imagine their surprise when they found out the girl with the purple hair and knee length boots took care of their dinner. It gives me the warm and fuzzies, and I really hope it made their day.

Late night inspiration,Chituck,"Last weekend, I was walking late at night down a street in Chicago that it isn't always advisable to travel at night. About a half block ahead of the group I was in, I saw a group of about ten people, mostly men, wearing dark clothes. They were hooting and hollering, and instantly my guard went up as we were about to walk right through this rowdy group. 
Right as I was in their midst, guard still up, I realized where I am and who they are. I was standing in front of the Chicago Philippine Heritage Center, and these men were merely yelling because they had spent so much time filling a semi-truck container with donations to send to the Philippine typhoon victims, and they were excited and proud to have accomplished their task.
I guess with all the crime related news coverage, I was quick to think of the safety of my friends and I, but, it was a refreshing reminder that motivated people can do a lot of good, even at night. ",0

Guy let me go after bumping his car with mine in traffic.,wizardbrigade,"So I was driving in pretty terrible traffic and had stopped behind this white SUV. I had been stuff in traffic for a while and was getting lethargic when I accidentally let my foot slip and sort of just rolled into the guy in front of me. It happened really quickly and although I didn't hit him hard (since I was at a complete stop prior) I was really worried that  this would be reported to my insurance and that my insurance would go up, as I'm a student and already struggling to cover my tuition. I was so mad at myself as I got out of the car to exchange information. The whole thing was just idiotic of me and so easily could have been avoided if I had just made an effort to be alert. But then, as the guy got out of his car and took a look at the back, he declared that it looked like there was no damage and told me not to bother giving him my information. I have to admit, I was pretty floored. I asked him if he was absolutely sure and he told me, ""Yeah, don't worry about it!"" It was incredibly kind of him.  
  
Anyhow, that was a couple of month ago and I had to post in here because recently I was driving in traffic again, and I will be damned if the guy behind me didn't roll into the back of my car. I got out, looked at my car, and thought about how much of a relief it was when I had done the same thing and the guy I hit was realistic about it. The guy that hit me had just rolled into my car from a complete stop, as I had done prior, and my car looked completely fine. I told him not to worry about it. He looked totally shocked, as I had been, and asked me if I was sure. I told him yes and then he thanked me profusely, which was nice of him.  
  
I had to post this here because I can't believe I got the opportunity to pay it forward in such exact circumstances. Pretty crazy! Keep the kindness going out there :)",0

My first post here I hope you like it.,milanbourbeck,"I was on my way to work (I travel with train every morning ~45min) and a guy in camoflage pants and jacket entered the train. He had a big backpack with him and seemed to be homeless. At the first view it was something totally normal you see everyday in this city but after taking a second look I noticed something under his pullover. After 2-4 minutes a little head looked out of his cleavage. It was a little cute kitty with a necklace and she seemed to enjoy the little ride with his guy. I and the other people around were staring at that guy like a fucking elk looking into headlights when he took the cat out of his pullover and took care of her. I was thining about taking a picture but thought that this guy has more than those problems and He might get angry. He seemed to be drunk a little. It looked like the cat wasn't frightend at all and she was also well fed. Apperently the guy and I had to get out of at the same station and I thought about doing this 30 minutes. I got a new job 2 Weeks ago and I earn my first money. I'm under 18. I think it's hilarious much to get 700€ when not beeing able to spend it because i have almost no free time. I thought by myself: FUCK IT! When we got out I went over to that guy and I hand him 5 bucks and said: ""Take care of that cat for me. Don't waste it.""

He was saying nothing and just staring at me while I was walking down the stairs to get the subway. I didn't feel good or bad when doing this. I just thought that this should be everybodys job. If you have almost everything in your life that you need like food a house and a bed than you can give a tiny bit to people that don't have it. I strongly belive in the Speech: ""today you, tomorrow me"" and even if not. I know that I am a good person and I don't have to lie about myself which makes you feel better. Today a guy in the line needed 60cents for a coffee but didn't had enough. I gave him 60 cents and told him to enjoy it. His face was speechless and I think I made his day. You guys won't believe me how easy it is to make people happy. Don't always with money.

TL;DR: Guy with a cat in his arm walks into a train. I gave him 5 bucks. Think about people who have less than you and be selfless sometimes.",0
Almost got stranded at work tonight,Cariaian,"I work at a mall that's about a 15 minute drive away from my campus and I was working the closing shift.

So I was standing out in the cold for almost an hour, when a taxi cab driver asked if I needed a cab. I told him I had no money and he told me to go ahead and get in. He took me almost all the way to my school for free so I didn't have to walk all the way.",0
Left the UCLA vs. Washington State game at the Rose Bowl tonight and got stuck in a sand trap.,Niko_Neko,"My childhood friend, M, and I decided to immortalize our admissions into UCLA by attending our first UCLA football game together. It also was my first ever college football game, so I was properly dressed and excited to get into things. Arriving fairly close to kick off, we were directed to a nearby golf course to park instead of the regular concrete lot. We didn't think too much of it as we were just glad to be parked and on our way.


It was a great game- Washington State had an amazing offense and things were getting close as we entered the 4th quarter 27-24. We managed to pull through to 33-24 when we decided that it might be a good idea and a safe point to leave, so as to avoid the insane mess of cars that's sure to come; we came, we saw, and we sorta’ conquered- it was time to get some food. We find my car in the outskirts of the pseudo lot and promptly moved the only direction we could have, following behind a truck. I should've figured something was amiss when said truck stopped abruptly before gunning forward into what looked like a small dip. Not thinking anything of it and assuming that it was just a small hill (we were in a golf course after all), I followed behind him and found myself dipping into a sand trap. Living up to its name, my little Scion xB found itself trapped in this sandy pit of doom. My friend ran off to find some help as I threw on my hazards and sat there questioning my common sense (you are in a golf course…golf courses don’t just have hills…they have sand traps and sandy places which are not front-wheel drive friendly…). When he returned, it was to the realization that parking attendants are not around and neither are many other cars or people. To make matters worse, I don’t have a cell phone and his died getting us to the Rose Bowl- we were at the mercy of kind Samaritans.


Fellow Bruins walked by, staring but not helping. A gentleman (Bruin fan, based on his attire) lamented with us of being stuck as well, but he had called AAA, so help was still coming. A car waited behind us, not realizing that what laid before us was not something they wanted any part of. We managed to employ their help to try to push the car out of the pit- no dice.  I sat and tried to keep my anxiety at bay, making comments about how life is just a bunch of interesting adventures and that it was going to be okay. M was sweet and smiled along with me. I’m not sure how much of it he believed and how much he was just trying to console me. 


And then the first group arrived. A charismatic thespian of a Bruin comes to my window, boldly declaring that I was, ironically, trapped in a sand trap. With sing-song voice and the determination of a well-seasoned actor, he captures the attention of four drunken, but good-natured Huskies. “What are your plans, mi’lady?” Am I dreaming? Is this real life? Shakespeare incarnate is leading four drunken men to my rescue- well, beggars can’t be choosers so I played along and declared that I would accept any help that I could get, but that we had tried all methods of pushing and pulling- we weren’t going anywhere without the arriving aid of AAA. Hearing that I had gotten help through AAA, Thesbruin bids me farewell and good luck; one of the Huskies walks over to my window and offers me a swig of his bottle of Fireball “to make the sucky night a little better”; I declined, but was warmed by their collective good nature. Some time passes and the second group of Huskies arrive.

“You’re stuck pretty good.”

“Don’t I know it, haha…”

“My buddy over there is a course engineer- if he walks away from this, THEN you know you’re in trouble. But he thinks he can get you out.”


Sure enough, his buddy walked around my car and examines the wheels and the location and goodness knows what else before concluding that with some good muscle, pushing me into the pit and letting me run off the momentum, that I’d be able to clear the trap entirely. With few options, I took my chances with their help; what’s the worst that can happen at this point, especially with AAA coming? But true to his word, the Huskies pulled (or rather, pushed) through and I cleared the pit to the cheers of onlookers and participants alike. I got out of the car and hugged everyone that helped and thanked them as best I could. I later learned that Washington State lost and it was just that much more meaningful that the guys that came to help me really had no reason to- I was pretty UCLA’ed out; there was no mistaking that. But I guess it goes to show that good sportsmanship is very much alive and that it’s good to have faith in humanity. Thanks for everything, kind Huskies; ya'll are great ♥

**TL;DR: Fat bear got stuck in a sand trap; pushed out by some awesome Huskies.**",0

Went to Olive Garden yesterday for some veterans day food.,wtfsystem,"So me and my group of friends decided it was time to leave base for once and go out for some real food. Since it was veterans day, a lot of restaurants were offering free entrees, appetizers, some were even offering free whole meals. We decided on Olive Garden. After about an hour and a half wait in line, we were finally sat down. We all ordered from a special menu of what they were offering us for free. I ended up ordering a little extra stuffed mushrooms, which was not on the free list. Later while receiving our receipts, I noticed our waitress had put down my mushrooms as a complimentary item. I was stoked, so I offered to round up a few of the guys checks and just pay for all of it. When she came back, she informed me that when she went to pay, my debt came out as zero, which meant I didn't owe them anything. Now I'm not as naive to think this was just massive amounts of good karma built up. She had to have been pulling strings for me, and for that, I thank her. So if y'all are ever up in Minot North Dakota, head over to the Olive Garden here. The staff is excellent and deserves your business.

TLDR; Me and my military buddies ate at Olive Garden for free because my waitress was a badass.",0

Chick-Fil-A Soilder of Hope,xxibigmacixx,"Lets start off with a little bit of background info. I work at a fast food joint, unless you ask the owner who would tell you its a ""Quick Service Restaurant"", in other words, chick-fil-a. My boss is all about making money, its all about the food costs being as low as possible and labor never reaching a high percentage. Yeah, he's that kind of guy. But anyway, working at a fast food place you certainly notice some of the strange people the inhabit this little blue dot we call home. I have had everything from creeps, pedophiles, thieves, slobs, sluts, druggies, the whole 9 yards. As well as the strange though, of course we get the incredibly rude. The ones who lie to get more food for free, always insist we are wrong, and generally leave huge messes for others to clean. Those are the people that have turned me into the sour, people hating, ""certified trainer"" that I am.

Then I was at work today, working an 8am - 8pm, struggling not to jump off the roof from the torture. Its a pretty average morning, I go out in the cow van to pick up a produce order for the day, drink some coffee, clean, all that fun stuff. Generally we have a rush for breakfast that lasts from about 9:40 to close to 11, but it goes by quick enough. The breakfast rush is done and over with, I had more than my fair share of complaints in that short period of time, ""What do you MEAN breakfast is OVER?!"" or my more recent favorite, due to the marketing idea of a free breakfast item each day, ""So what the free breakfast is over, it ended 20 minutes ago, i was in traffic so i should still get it!"". Basically I hate people.

Then came lunch. It started slow and creeps into a long drawn out rush as usual, but with twice the complaints/mess involved. So naturally, when a genuinely nice customer approaches, i get excited. Call me crazy. I'm not psychic, but this guy immediately made his intentions clear, and they were nothing but good. He approached the register and got straight to the point. He told the cashier that he $100 in his hand that he wanted to use to pay for the next few customers in line. Instantly this simple act of random kindness put a smile on my face. We got him set up with his card and he handed it to me and I proceeded to explain to the following customers that a random stranger has paid for their meals, easily making some of their days just that much better. Every single one of them smiled and asked where they could thank this fast food hero. I informed them that he had no intention of drawing attention to himself or taking credit and left right after the purchase.

But wait, theirs more! An older gentleman approaches me with his family. He places his order, and of course its paid for by the stranger. He smiles, and informs me that he is a retired army general and that this was the nicest thing done for him in a while, so much in fact that he would like to continue the act by buying an additional card. He bought a card for $30 and asked me to pay for any military personal that ordered.

It's nice to know that in a world so filled with terrible people and actions, their still really is a few people who genuinely care about the happiness of others. It really turned my whole day around.",0

I got locked out of my car last night.,alc6379,"I wanted to share a story about what happened to me last night, just to illustrate how lucky I am: 

I pull up to my Tae Kwon Do school for class. I get out of the car and shut the door, only to realize that somehow, stupidly, I'd left the keys in the ignition, car running. 

Damn it. 

I walk into a store where I know the owner, and he gives me a coat hanger to try and use to open the door. I'm outside in the rain, trying to make this thing work, when suddenly, I look back. There's a guy getting out of a van. He hands me a book and says, ""here, look up your car model and read to me what it says.""

So I take the book, find FORD, and read ""Use tool 80a."" 

He goes, ""Word,"" reaches in a bag, and I shit you not, he's got a full set of door opening tools, slim jims, wedges, etc. He starts sliding the slim jim into the window, wiggles a little, and *pop*, the door unlocks. 

I'm like, ""OH MY GOD DUDE THANKS SO MUCH."" 

He shakes my hand, nods, and says, ""Bitches and money, man. Bitches and money."" Then he just walks away, gets in his van, and drives off. 

I don't get how this kind of stuff happens to me. Normally, seems like anybody else would be stuck jerking around with a clothes hanger, calling AAA, or having a friend bring a key. Me? Nope. Dope-ass strangers show up out of nowhere with exactly the tools to get me situated. 

Wanna know the real kicker? Class was canceled for the night due to Halloween.

"Redditor /u/sixfootfree just helped fulfil a 20 year long dream. Just because, apparently.",Worlds_biggest_cunt,"A few months back, there was a thread on Reddit, about childhood toys or items that had been lost, and you were never able to find again. (I'm having a hard time finding that thread, ironically). Anyway:

I randomly mentioned a series of graphic novels that I collected when I was a kid, about 20 years ago, called ""The Ancestral Trail"". However, they were thrown away by my mom and I was never able to find them again. It really sucked because it was so awesome and I never got to find out how the story ended. 

If you had to try and find the entire complete set online, you will not be able to do so. It literally doesn't exist in its entirely, anywhere on the internet. I HAVE TRIED FOR YEARS TO FIND THEM ALL!

You can find the odd book here and there but the majority of the 52 were never able to be found.

A lot of redditors were actually kind enough to try and find me a few links to some of the books they had found, and of course this was hugely appreciated, but still, most of the books were simply not there.

Then, /u/sixfootfree messages me and tells me he has the entire collection, and that I can have it. For free because he doesnt want it and can see it means a lot to me. Hopefully he can also confirm my rabid attempts throw all my money in his face and name my first-born child after him. But he would have none of it. Wouldnt even accept postage. He posted it to me from the UK and when I opened the box, about 2 months later, I couldn't actually believe it. He sent every single one of the 52 books, along with the binders. mini booklets. I nearly pissed my pants.

I took a few photographs (There are over 800 fully illustrated pages). What I plan to do (per /u/sixfootfree 's only condition), is that I get the entire series scanned and uploaded for all to enjoy. Because AFAIK, I am the only motherfucker on the planet that has the entire collection now.

My friend runs a professional printing press, and I will get him to scan the entire thing soon enough. When I have that, I will come back and post the link so you can all enjoy it too.

Thank you so much /u/sixfootfree, I know this all may not seem like much to some, but this ends 20 years of swollen, blue balls from not knowing how this amazing series ends. Also, just the act of what you did amazed me. You restore my faith in people, and I will make the same attempt to help someone else like you have, when I can.  You have helped me fulfil something that has been a thorn in my side for 2 decades, and for that, I thank you.

Also, dont care what you say, we are sending you a fuckton of Timtams and various other cool stuff now that I have your address.

Made her day.,Laserhellman,"I was at my local High School football game for my old highschool because some friends asked me to come and cheer them on. As I'm sitting there in the 40-50 degree weather I notice this little girl next to me, she's about 1 and a half. She's just kind of stumbling around when all of a sudden she drops he blanket under the stands. During the entire rest of the game I search for and find a way underneath and using my ultra stealth skills to not get caught I go under the bleachers to retrieve the blanket for the child. The bleachers are coated with fencing and it was quite difficult finding a way in and doing so without getting caught and thrown out. The look on the little girls face when she got back her blanket was priceless. No one should be cold during a football game especially

RaoK Holiday Challenge,megthegreatone,"I have been having a very hard time with depression the last month. It's upsetting to me because October - December is my absolute favorite time of the year (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas). So I have decided I want to try something this year, both for selfish reasons (to try to get out of my depression) and to spread what I believe is the spirit of the greatest time of the year, and want to see if anyone else might be up for it. 

For the entire holiday season (which I am arbitrarily labeling as November 1 until December 31), I want to set a challenge to myself and to all others who want to participate to perform one random act of kindness a day. Things I am thinking of:

* Picking up someone's tab for dinner

* Baking cookies for neighbors, coworkers, and clients

* Leaving friendly anonymous notes for people who look like they could use a pick-me-up

Really anything could work - it's called ""*Random* acts of kindness"" for a reason. Just keep an eye out for things that are needed and try to make the world a little bit brighter, one day at a time. 

If you want to do it and want to document it, that'd be amazing - I'd love to see what you guys can come up with. I don't know if I'll be documenting what I do, since I really don't want to draw attention to myself, but it'd be great to know that other people might be interested in this project :)",0
Had a hotel maid put $200 back in my jeans pocket while I was at work.,remotelove,"Was mad that my money was ""stolen"" off the table, was very happy that it was sorted AND nicely folded in a pair of jeans that was on the back of the room couch.  There was a DND sign on the door.  Fucking awesome.

What kind thing did you do today?,,"I was feeling a bit down and bored today, so I went for a drive to a disadvantaged area near where I grew up. Most stores close early today, so I sat drinking a bottle of water in my car in front of some stores, occasionally driving around to try (lamely) to diagnose which wheel on my car was squeaky. A few local kids came to the car and asked for change for something to drink. I had just seen them, obviously bored, climbing on the roof of a store, and it seemed like they were from pretty poor circumstances... so I did them one better: it was almost time for dinner, so I bought them dinner from a local place and they were happy like crazy. I think they ran home with it :-)

Certainly lifted my spirits :-) I might have to make it a definite plan for each day to do something nice.

Stewardess and passengers going above and beyond...,senseandsarcasm,"This happened several years ago, but it has always stuck with me.  

I live in a small-ish city in a Southeastern U.S. state.  I was at the airport waiting for my flight to Atlanta, and a connecting flight there.  The plane, however, had mechanical issues and our nighttime flight was just announced as completely cancelled.  We were being put on the first flight to Atlanta the next morning.  I prepared to head home, irritated as hell, when I saw a smallish group of people surrounding two passengers...

It was an elderly woman and her toddler grandson.  She had left Albany, NY that morning and was desperately trying to get to Florida, as her son was in the hospital and dying.  This flight being cancelled meant she was going to miss her Atlanta connection and not get there tonight.  She was overwhelmed, crying, confused and didn't know what was going to happen or how it was all going to work.

The stewardess that was there explained that she would be put up in a hotel for the evening, get money for dinner tonight, and be taken back to the airport in the morning.  She didn't even have luggage because she had left without even planning, just wanted to get to her son.   A passenger started opening her carry on, pulling out a small t-shirt for the grandson, a small toothpaste, soon other people were doing the same.  In minutes they had a bag of necessities and a few toys for the grandson from other passengers.

The stewardess then looked her right in the eye and said, you will make that plane in the morning and you don't need to worry about it, I'm going to escort you every step of the way.   She evidently took the woman to the hotel, made sure she got checked in, and then took them to dinner.

The next morning, there was grandma and grandson, being escorted by the same stewardess, who took them through check in and all the way to the gate, as promised.   ",0

Just found this subreddit - I have really awesome friends.,enostradamus,"My friend invited me a couple weeks ago to go to the casino with him to celebrate his girlfriend's birthday. I was hesitant to go at first because I've been strapped for cash - and I think he picked up on that. He got my girlfriend and me a room at the casino and a little bit of cash so we could celebrate with him. I know it's not necessarily a huge deal; but I've never really had friends go out of their way to finance it so we could all party together. There was no pretense, and nothing was asked in return. Makes me really appreciate the closeness I have with my friends.",0
My good deed for today...,bubonis,"**TL;DR: Found a retired man's ID, credit cards, and other important bits at a car show. Tracked him down and returned it all. Turns out he lives two miles from my house and he gave my daughter $20 in appreciation.**

I spent most of the day today at Raceway Park in Englishtown, NJ, for their fall car show/swap meet. Unfortunately I didn't come home with what I was looking for, but I did come home with a good deed under my belt.

I was wandering around the many swap meet booths and found myself looking at some random tools. I reached the edge of the booth and saw, sitting amongst a collection of buffing wheels and such, a pile of plastic cards. I looked around, thinking perhaps someone temporarily left them there, but nobody was there. I scooped them up and took a look, finding (among other things) a ""retired employee"" ID card (yes, it really said that), a Visa credit card, and a Visa platinum debit card. The ID card had a name (let's call him ""Bob"") and photograph on it. I quickly looked around but didn't see a matching face. I took a brisk walk up and down the aisle in both directions and didn't find him.

Detective time! I pulled out my cell phone, hit whitepages.com, and did a search. Success! I found two matching names that were listed as being aged 55 or older. Called them both, got voice mail, left messages telling the person that I was looking for Bob because he dropped something at the show and I wanted to give it back. I then found a business card in the stack with a name on it that was the same as Bob's last name. It had two numbers; both also went to voice mail so I left messages on both. I then went to the security booth at the show, explained the situation, and gave them my name, phone number, and Bob's name. I left the show about a half hour later with the cards in my pocket.

On the way home I was running some errands and got three phone calls. First was Bob's son (one of the numbers from the business card), then Bob himself, then Bob's daughter-in-law (the other number from the business card). It turns out Bob didn't even know that the cards were missing; they dropped out of his wallet when he went to pay for the buffing wheels he picked up and never noticed.

I finished my errands, had dinner with my daughter, then we went to Bob's house to give him back his stuff. He offered me $20 as a reward which I refused to take, so he reached into my car and handed the money to my six year old daughter who, despite being told not to take the money, gleefully took it and announced she would put it in her piggy bank.

Thus, my good deed for the day.

Met a kind lady while San Francisco public transportation,Blu3Dream,"Not being on a field trip since middle school, I decided to go to a San Francisco museum exhibit for a Saturday extra credit opportunity. I took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) from Berkeley to SF. I never used San Francisco's public bus system so I didn't know what to expect so I stocked up on quarters. While waiting for the bus, I was holding on to about $2.50 in quarters and fiddling with them in my hands. There was an elderly Chinese lady sitting next to me, also waiting for the bus. She started speaking to me in Chinese and I don't speak Chinese so I had no option but to communicate to her in English. She was still speaking to me in Chinese and she pointed to the quarters I had in my hand. Then I thought ""Oh, I think she needs money for the bus"" so I held out my hand with a fistful of quarters and she took $0.75. I felt good because I just helped out an elderly lady with her bus fare. 

When the bus arrived, she handed me a card. I was confused so I looked at the card more carefully then I saw that it was an unlimited ride monthly pass. She put in the $0.75 cents and I swiped the card. As she found her seat, she pointed back to the card, and I gave her the card back. Then it finally clicked! I would have costed me $2.00 to ride, but she let me use her monthly pass, while she got the senior citizen discount! It saved me $1.25 in all! I thought I was helping her with $0.75, but in the end she was helping me the whole time.",0
BUSINESS MAN AT AIRPORT DOES RANDOM ACT TO HELP A STRANDED BROKE YOUNG MAN,lh917,"In August of 2012, I was a few months out of rehab for my heroin addiction.  I was staying clean but I was having trouble making ends meet.  (Broke actually)  I was just going through a lot mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.  I had relocated across the country to leave the environment that I had grown up in because it was driving me to the grave. Literally. 

I was able to land a half descent job and an opportunity to start over.  The company that I was hired by had flown me to Houston for a training period.  On the way home, my first flight to Dallas was running late and I only had a one hour layover before my second flight home.  Once we took off from Houston to DFW, I asked the flight attendant what would happen if we didn't land in time.  She had told me that I would probably be out of luck and would have to catch a flight until the next day.  An older woman at the front of the plane heard me talking and gave up her seat to me so that I could be one of the first people off the plane to run to my next flight.  Well this is very kind in and of itself but this isn't what my post is about...

Once we had landed and I had run off of the plane asking another passenger where he thought my gate was.  He pointed me in a direction and I had run off. Well...I missed my second flight home.  About an hour later, I was aimlessly walking around the airport talking to American Airlines recordings trying to figure out how to get them to buy me a room,  (because I’m broke) since it was kind of their fault I missed my second flight.  Well they wouldn't.  Also, it was after business hours and I could not get my company credit card numbers for a hotel.  Well that is when I ran into that guy again that had pointed me to the direction of the gate of my second flight.  He said something along the lines of ""well I guess you missed your flight.""  

I explained to him what was going on with trying to get a room from AA or my company.  He told me he was walking across the road to a nice hotel and that I could join him for a drink while I was waiting for a response.  I came to find out (and I still remember these details vividly) he was a Russian business man named Youri.  He had this huge indestructible laptop with him.  He was an entrepreneur who was somehow involved in building inspection of some sort on a national basis.  When we walked in the front of the hotel across from DFW and the receptionist knew who he was so I was under the impression that he was probably well off from his business. I felt good knowing that he was even acknowledging my existence. 
I told him my life story over a few drinks and he was very genuinely interested.  He talked about building his company from the ground up and left me quite inspired.  After my problems continued trying to get a room, he paid our drinks, left the hotel bar and walked to the receptionist desk.  He said “Ma’am can you please take care of this young man and put it on my card.”  I was so absolutely blown away.  I told him I had a twenty in my wallet which I would give to him, then and if he gave me his address I would mail him a check once I started receiving my pay checks.  He laughed and told me not to worry about it.  He said “do something nice for someone someday when they can’t help themselves.”  This really does give me goose bumps just thinking about it.  I have done a few things for people just thinking back on this random guy, Youri.  Thanks again Youri.  You are a very admirable man and have made quite an impact on my life in the one hour that I spent with you.  That’s over a year ago now.  Youri, if you ever see this, know that an impact is being made on the world, due to a good GOD working through you and making an impact on other people.  It was not only the money for the room but also for just being there and lending and ear to listen to a strangers problems.  He helped a recovering addict who was so undeserving and had a genuine impact on my life.  THANKS AGAIN!!!

A random act of encouragement (With challenge included!),LordMalevolence,"Hey guys and gals,
I’ve recently been challenged by a wee group I am part of to a) perform and b) encourage as many random acts of kindness, big or small, in as many communities as possible up until the 18th of September, of course documenting these with pictures or videos up to 15s long along the way! This is a movement started in little old New Zealand, but with all intentions for it to spread as far as it can increasing the profile of what random acts we can do!

To do this, I personally will be going out of my way to complete a list of kind acts supplied by myself and my peers in an attempt to make other people’s days way better! However, me alone doing this isn’t going to make the impact we want, so I instead am asking as many of you as possible to do your bit, and as many bits as you can, to help out wherever you may be to make someone’s life a little bit better! Once you’ve done a lovely act of random kindness, then document it somehow and either upload it to Instagram with the tag #fxosc or send a copy to fxrandomkindness@gmail.com !

These will all be grouped up for a (hopefully!) huge collection at the end, showing the difference a simple act can make! So get out there, be proud of what you can do, and be kind!",0

MTA Cinderella Story,catcafegirl,"Last call for the L train to Brooklyn. I make it just in time when I realize...one of my flip flops is...not...on my foot. My eyes grow wide and I gasp. There it was, abandoned on the platform, a single black flip flop flipped on its back. I could see it, only a few inches away from the entrance to the train, but I couldn't move. I was frozen in place like a flamingo in the headlights. Suddenly, I felt a stranger's hand touch my arm, and watched him bend down to retrieve my flip flop literally a second before the doors closed. He handed it to me with a big heroic smile and then disappeared into the crowded train.

This man not only made me feel like a Disney princess but saved me from a pathetic hop back home. Whenever I feel like this world is going to shit, I'll think of him and remember that there is still hope. If you're out there and reading this, thank you so much for your act of kindness.",0

"Long time ""regular"" shows her kindness .",RhubarbCharb,"I work at a grocery store and we have regular customers come in and out every day. There are a handful that I talk to on the regular, the kind of people I go out of my way to say hello to. It's usually small talk and things going on during that particular time of year. 

I had mentioned that I got engaged a few weeks ago to this particular woman that comes in to our store regularly. This morning on my opening shift, she came in at around 7:20AM. We chatted briefly, I told her I might be moving into an apartment soon with my my fiancée. 
""What's her name?""
""It's ________""
She asked for the correct spelling and said that her daughter had the same name etc. We spoke until the next customers arrived and she was off.
10 mins go by and she came by again. 
""It's just a little something, congratulations! You've always been so nice and I wanted to get you guys something.""

I opened up the card after she left. It was an engagement card with a $50 bill inside. I was shocked. I was grateful but at the same time, I didn't know how to feel. I also felt a little guilty taking it. 

After a couple of minutes, I thought about how weird it was. I couldn't get the smile off my face, a random person that I had a work relationship with just dropped $50 to me. It was such kind gesture that I'm not used to seeing, especially where I work! She made my day!

Someone returned my wallet after one of my worst nights in my life. They ended up saving my life.,ElDjebena,"I had recently broke up with my girlfriend, and we had agreed to talk it out. While I was filling up my car with gas at the gas station, I left my wallet on top of my car and drove away. It fell off halfway to my house around the corner, and I panicked, cancelled everything.

I then proceeded to have a talk with my girlfriend that ended up confirming our breakup, revealing cheating, lying, and more. 
She threatened to ""ruin my reputation"" and ""make sure you never get anything nice in your life again"".

We had been together for two years and this was the last straw. I drank more than I could ever imagine and I felt completely alone.
I couldn't imagine a lower point in my life and my mind started to tell me to take a bunch of pills and all that. 

Then the phone rang. Someone found my wallet on the road. The guy came over, saw that I was completely out of my mind and gave me my wallet - cash still inside, nothing taken.

I offered a reward and I tried to thank him but he had none of it. It was a little gesture, but it meant more to me than he'll ever know. I truly believe I would have hurt myself and others that night, but I was just so thankful that I went straight to bed.

This probably sounds really scripted and cliche but it was a while ago, and my mind has probably selected the best bits and pieces of this story. Nonetheless, I've returned 3 wallets since and each time I've hoped that I was doing something as important as that was to me.

To My Favorite Delta Employee,atlas1171,"I just got off the phone with a Delta service rep.  I was foolish and did not elect to take the customer satisfaction survey after the call was through (I didn't anticipate what was to come).  My girlfriend and I are doing a long distance relationship and she was scheduled to fly up next week to visit me.  We became aware that she could have flown up earlier than we had initially anticipated and so I told her I would pay to change the flight.

So I called Delta.  After dealing with a rather idiotic robot voice, I finally got to a human being.  I ought to be clear--this man was a true human being.

After telling him I wanted to change my girlfriend's flight, he said: ""Now, not to get all up in your personal reasoning, but would you tell me why you're trying to change your flight, maybe I can save you some money.""  I told him that I did not have a money-saving reason--I simply wanted to pay for my girlfriend's flight so I could see her earlier/for more time.  He thanked me for my honesty, said I wouldn't believe how many times people would lie to him just to save a few bucks, and then told me he was going to waive the fee anyway.

""Sometimes, I can tell when somebody just needs a break.""
""Well--I really, really appreciate that.""
""Oh I know you do son, don't worry about it.  Have a safe trip and God bless.""
""Thank you so much.  You too.""

I wanted to see my girlfriend--which is selfish of me.  But I was more than willing to pay the fee and I didn't want to lie about someone dying or being sick just to save some money.  This guy was appreciative of that and showed me some real kindness.  Thank you Delta, and thank you customer service rep.  You've made a young couple incredibly happy!

McDonald's smiles. :),Saavedrac,"Today my husband decided he wanted to have McDonald's. So I packed up my 10 year old daughter and decided to go through the drive thru and take it home.

I pull forward pay for our meals with my debit card, pull out extra cash and ask the cashier to let me pay for the lady's food behind me.

The cashier shakes her head no, smiles, looks at us, and hands her the note. The lady is so confused at this point it was almost funny. The lady reads the note, smiles, and starts to wipe tears from her eyes. We get our food and start to leave when my oldest turns around with tears in her eyes and says ""Mom, you notice she is by herself? Maybe we were the only ones today to show we cared. We didn't do anything big just gave her a smile and a sandwich."" I tell her that is why we should be kind because a smile may be all they have. Oh random acts of kindness thank you again for teaching me that a smile can worth a million bucks and a very good life lesson. :) ",0
Tipping a new employee/ small thing to do if you get good service.,dapperslendy,"So I just recently joined reddit and found this sub (believe that is what it is called) and I remember last year I went to a restaurant with friends and there were about 10 of us and we find out our waitress is brand new and it is her first night there. Services goes really well and no bumps in the road for her (I assume she has done this type of job before) yet even though she did a good job. I first find the manager and give them a rave review about her and then I tipped her a big chuck and wrote a note saying that she does well at the job.

Now here is a tip for an easy RAOK whether you are at McDonalds or a Fancy 5 star restaurant one thing to do is if your waiter/waitress did a good job or even just an average job what you can do is either ask them to get the manager or when leaving ask someone else to talk to a manager or call in. The best though is when you ask them, they get all flustered but here is the catch you tell their manager what a great job they did and you were impressed by the... The smiles you see on their faces are always priceless and worth just saying those kind worlds. Just food *pun intended :P* for thought.  ",0
My Wife Medical Paranoia Saved Me Life Last Night.,,"I had been suffering from what I thought was a stomach bug since Tuesday, July 30, 2013 at 4:00am.  I went to work my day job and my night job as usually with no improvements.  My wife (Reddit Handle: Shadylane85) thought that it was a sign of a heart attack or maybe an issue with my Gall Bladder.  I went Tommy day job the following day and left early as she convinced me to go see a doctor. (I am a bit stubborn in wanting to go to the doctors because I have been a contractor forthe last 7 years and have not had medical insurance until recently switch to another job 4 months agao).  Well blood work came back fine but the pain in the stomach had a story to tell.  After a ct scan and a few hours of waiting I was diagnosed with appendicitis.  I was told yo go home and wait for the hospital to call me and confirm my emergency surgery.  At around 8:00pm my wife noticed I looked different.  She called the hospital and apparently they were waiting for.me sinc 5:00pm and that I did not have to wait for scheduling. She packed my stuff and drove me to the hospital.  They put me to sleep and started the surgery and my appendix burst during it.  I owe my life to my wife and I cannot express in words how much I appreciate her.  She gave me the gift of being able to see my 3 little boys again.  She is an active participant of Reddit for many years and has been apart of many exchanges.  If Reddit could reach out to her and just say a few words of how great of a person she was being by my side I would be greatly appreciative.  I would even go get a tattoo of the little Reddit mascot (sorry I am new to this and don't know his name) with a surgeons mask and an appendix in his hands to display my appreciation permanently.  Thank you Redditors!",0
